# woof hex

A GPU-accelerated, global variable-resolution atmospheric model core driven
from the WOOF engine. Its CUDA path uses Python and CuPy; an implemented Metal
forecast path is also available on Apple Silicon. See the shared
[backend guide](../../docs/public/BACKENDS.md) for supported coverage and
selectors. The physics runs through the WOOF engine's column-batch seam, so the
regional and Hex models share one implementation.

*(MPAS-Atmosphere is a registered project of NCAR and LANL. This distribution
is an independent port and is not affiliated with or endorsed by them. The name
is used here only to say which model was ported.)*

Hex supports global and limited-area meshes, including storm-following tools.
Most measurements below describe the CUDA route; Metal supports an implemented
subset of forecasts on Apple Silicon. See [Backends](../../docs/public/BACKENDS.md).
Multi-GPU execution is not shipped.

## What is proven

Measured, on an RTX 5090:

- 24 h global forecasts at 720/720 steps, about 3.07 s/step, **deterministic**:
  two arms of the same run compared byte-for-byte and identical.
- 2-D Smagorinsky horizontal mixing, ported from the native Registry default and
  **on by default**, with a full A/B pass.
- Two-node multi-GPU, bitwise partition-invariant against the single-GPU
  reference. Built and proven, **not shipped**: there is no door on it.
- 702 product PNGs rendered through the Rust renderer.
- The init door reproduces 92/92 carried fields bit-identically against a native
  golden init, and an init it produced started the port in a 5-step smoke.
- The render door produced 31/31 renderable products from a native history.
- Restart: checkpoint and restore with bitwise-identical continuation, in the
  full-physics proof harness the restarted history file is byte-identical
  (same SHA-256) to the uninterrupted run's.
- The engine-pin move onto the GF local-memory frame cut left the trajectory
  untouched: 132/132 history variables and every per-step atmosphere
  fingerprint byte-identical across 30 full-physics composite steps, against a
  1-ULP flip instrument the comparator flagged.
- Device footprint, measured at two meshes in one session at the merged tip: the published 40,962-cell
  global mesh peaks at **8,874 MiB** and the native x4.163842 at
  **20,446 MiB** on the 170 SM card. The model those points feed is **not a
  line in cell count**: it is a per-card core, plus the Grell-Freitas and
  YSU column workspaces charged at `min(cells, tile)`, plus a per-cell term,
  and it reproduces both peaks exactly.
  Every admission gate (the forecast door, `--preflight`, and the driver's
  own floor) answers from that one surface (`woof.hex.device_admission`),
  which reads the card's multiprocessor count at the moment of the decision.

Measured on an RTX 3080, a 10 GiB Ampere card:

- **A limited-area forecast runs the full physics stack** (WSM6,
  Grell-Freitas, YSU, YSU-GWDO, revised-MO, NoahMP, cloud fraction and RRTMG)
  behind lateral boundary conditions built from its own coarse parent. Six
  hours, 1,080/1,080 steps, 13 history frames on an 11,020-cell culled mesh,
  peak **6,224 MiB**, median 0.271 s/step, 343 rendered products. Against a
  global full-physics run over the same ground at t+6 h: theta 1.117 K RMS
  (r = 0.999973), precipitation r = 0.95, reflectivity r = 0.82, vertical
  velocity r = 0.621. The cull is
  11.0x fewer cells and 5.1x less memory than the global refined mesh that
  covers the same storm.
- **Four independently placed fine grids, over four different kinds of
  weather**, each built and run full physics in sequence on one card:
  1,080/1,080 steps every time.
- **The cascade follows weather across cycles.** `woof hex cycle run`
  re-detected six hours on and continued all four slots (three reusing their
  mesh, one regenerating) over two cycles of one real case, 1,058 s total,
  peak 7,744 MiB. Starting a corridor from transplanted parent state instead
  of from the beginning saved **273.8 s, 43 %**, against a real baseline arm.
- **The domain-size question is measured, not assumed.** Five concentric culls
  of one parent against a no-boundary control: every field improves
  monotonically with cut width and the knee is at **1.35x** the fine core
  (`w` r 0.624 to 0.744, 2 m temperature r 0.578 to 0.852) for +27 % cells and
  +25 s of wall. That is the shipped default.

Also proven:

- **Earned timestep anchors at five timesteps** (120, 100, 75, 20 and 5 s)
  seven rows in all, because an anchor certifies a *configuration* (the
  timestep together with the cumulus selection) rather than a timestep alone.
  Each was earned with two byte-identical forecasts and a same-card control.
  20 s and 5 s are the textbook values for 3 km and 750 m, so a fine mesh has
  a timestep it can defend (`woof.hex.dt_admission`). **Only 120 s has a
  native reference, and only it ever can**: the rest are self-consistency
  anchors, and four of the seven rows record a divergence rather than a clean
  agreement. The lane was pinned to 120 s before this, which capped
  resolution at about 19 km.
- **Variable-resolution mesh generation**, spec-driven and deterministic, with
  a bind-time refusal for any mesh carrying a cell a Goldberg polyhedron
  cannot have. One graded mesh regenerates **bit-identical** to its registered
  bytes and completes a 6 h full-physics forecast.

## What is *not* claimed

It is not bit-identical to native MPAS and cannot be: native is single-precision
CPU, this is CUDA on sm_120. Over 24 h the two produce the same storms in the
same pattern with the same energy, with chaos-shaped divergence, and **three
bias-shaped differences that are declared divergences**. They are quantified
below, and [`docs/declared-divergences.md`](docs/declared-divergences.md)
carries the mechanism, the magnitude and the observational referee for each,
because a user deciding whether to trust a number needs them before the run,
not after.

**Physics parity against MPAS is not a goal of this project.** The port runs
WOOF's physics rather than MPAS's, so whole-model agreement with MPAS stopped
being reachable the moment that choice was made, which is why every remaining
difference below is physics-shaped. The **dynamical core stays pinned** to
native v8.4.1 and that pin is the correctness anchor. The physics is judged by
**obs-skill against MRMS and ASOS**, not by agreement with another model.

That changes the referee; it does not clear a finding. A bias that is wrong
against *observations* is still wrong. That comparison has now been made:
2026-08-25, four cases, Stage-IV precipitation, MRMS reflectivity and ASOS
surface. The
verdict for each divergence is in
[`docs/declared-divergences.md`](docs/declared-divergences.md).

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Python | 3.11 or newer |
| GPU | CUDA runs on supported NVIDIA/CUDA installations; Metal runs on Apple Silicon for the implemented forecast path. See the [backend guide](../../docs/public/BACKENDS.md). |

| Engine | The `woof` engine, `>=2.8.0,<2.9`, and pip resolves it for you: the physics seam, and the bundle that carries the MPAS bridge binaries the doors drive. The forecast runs on the installed engine; a git clone of woof is optional (receipts then name its commit); see *The engine*. |
| Assets | A mesh grid file, a matching static file, and (for the init door) a vertical-grid declaration: normally a `--vertical-spec` JSON; a native-minted init file as a capsule is the compatibility mode. **woof hex ships none of these and has no fetch path for them.** See *Assets you must supply*. |
| Rust binaries | `rw_mpas_init` for the init door; `rw_mpas_convert` and `rw_wrfbatch` for the render door. They are built from the `woof` source tree: see *Building the Rust engines*. |

### Install

```sh
pip install recast-woof
woof hex doctor
```

For CUDA extras, Apple Silicon/Metal requirements, and backend selectors, see
the [backend guide](../../docs/public/BACKENDS.md). Hex needs external mesh and
initial-condition assets plus its native init/render tools; `woof hex doctor`
reports missing requirements and their remedies.

### The import namespace

The distribution is `woof hex`, every command you type is `woof hex`, and the
**import namespace is `woof.hex`**: `import woof.hex`, not `import gpuwm_hex`.

It was `mpas_port` through 0.1.1 and the rename lands in 0.2.0. The old name
overclaimed the relationship. What this project keeps byte-identical is MPAS-A
v8.4.1's **dycore and mesh**: a specification, and it is pinned. It
deliberately does **not** match MPAS-A's physics, which is WRF physics run
through MPAS's own plumbing; WOOF's column-batch seam runs here instead. So
`mpas_port` put another project's name in every user's import line for a
relationship that only ever held over half the model. `woof.hex` names the two
things that ARE pinned (the hexagonal Voronoi mesh and the dycore) and it
matches the distribution name.

**This is a breaking change for code that imports the package directly.** There
is no `mpas_port` alias shim, because a shim keeps the overclaiming name alive
in the import line, which is the thing the rename removes. Rewrite
`import mpas_port` as `import woof.hex`; every module path underneath it is
unchanged.

*(The `hex` in the name is the hexagonal Voronoi mesh the model runs on.)*

### The engine

The port owns no physics: every column runs through the engine's column-batch
seam. Through 0.3.1 this distribution pinned that seam by the SHA-256 of
sixteen engine files and admitted exactly one published engine
(`woof>=2.7.4,<2.7.5`), because a separately published engine could carry
seam bytes the port was never run with. In WOOF the port and the engine ship
in one distribution from one commit, so that cannot happen in an install, and
the pin retired: the runtime byte check, the table of measured verdicts, the
admitted-engine table and the instrument that wrote them are gone.

What stays:

- **The run names its engine.** The forecast hashes the sixteen seam files
  (`woof.hex.engine_identity.SEAM_PATHS`) and records their digests, the
  engine's version and, for a git tree, its commit in every receipt and
  restart identity. A restart onto different engine bytes is refused.
- **The seam contract is held in the tree.** `tests/test_engine_seam_contract.py`
  compares the engine's `woof/core/mpas_column_batch.py` and
  `docs/mpas-seam.md` with the contract digest the adapter records. A change
  to either fails that test where it was made, so the contract decks and the
  x4 anchor are re-run on the new contract before the digest moves.
- **A missing seam file is refused by name**, at the door and in
  `woof hex doctor`, because the run could not name the bytes it executes.

While this tree still builds as its own distribution it declares
`woof>=2.8.0,<2.9`, the engine minor its CPU suite and seam contract test
ran against. Measured 2026-09-29 against the 2.8 head: 8 of the 16 seam files
moved since 2.7.4 (`config.py`, `physics.py`, `microphysics.py`, `gf.py`,
`kernels/gf.cu`, `kernels/__init__.py`, `rrtmg_legacy.py`, `io/restart.py`),
the seam contract surface and the composed glacier unit did not, and the old
pin would have refused the engine at launch.

The measurements behind the retired pin stay in
`verification/engine-verdicts/` as records; `docs/declared-divergences.md`
cites the seam changes they found.

The range also keeps a **second and independent** refusal where pip can make
it. The MPAS bridge binaries (`rw_mpas_init`, `rw_mpas_convert`,
`rw_mpas_mesh`, `rw_mpas_static`) entered woof's *bundle* at 2.5.3; their
rows landed the day after the 2.5.2 upload, so published 2.5.2 stages none of
them through `woof fetch-bridges`. Both front doors drive those binaries, so
a user who resolved onto a 2.5.2 engine could open **neither door**. That is a
stranded install rather than a degraded one, and a dependency floor is the
only place pip can refuse it. Measured 2026-08-28 on the then-pinned engine:
`woof fetch-bridges` from a published 2.5.8 install downloads
`gpuwm-bridges-v2.5.8-win-x86_64.zip` and stages **26 of 26 artifacts, each
verified against the packaged pin**, the four above, plus `rw_wrfbatch` and
the `rw_mpas_lbc` the limited-area lane needs.

*(The woof source tree publishes too: `github.com/recastsystems/woof`
carries tags `v2.5.0` through `v2.8.0` with the full tree, `docs/mpas-seam.md`
and `woof/core/mpas_column_batch.py` included. The table above was taken by
hashing the pinned files inside every published wheel, and the instrument
also hashes them at every one of those tags and records where a tag and its
wheel disagree, nowhere, from 2.5.8 up; the wheels before it simply do not
carry `docs/mpas-seam.md`, so the build road below is open to anyone,
subject to the 2.5.5 vendor gap noted above.)*

**Installing `woof` is all the forecast needs from the engine.** Since
0.3.2 the `forecast` door runs on the installed distribution: all sixteen
pinned seam files resolve from `site-packages` (from engine 2.5.8 on; this
port's seam inspection over a clean install reports `checked=16, matched=16,
moved=(), absent=()`), and the run names the executed seam source by the
install's version and the SHA-256 of pip's `RECORD` for that distribution.
Through 0.3.1 the door also demanded `--gpuwm-checkout`, a woof git clone at
the pinned tag, only so receipts could name a commit; that demand made the
forecast unreachable from `pip install woof hex`, and it is gone.
`--gpuwm-checkout` stays as an option: pass a clone of `v2.8.0` and the
receipt records its HEAD, tree and dirty paths instead. Any other directory
that is neither a git working tree nor the installed engine (an unpacked
tarball, a copied `site-packages`) is refused by name, because it names
neither a commit nor a record.

**The init and render doors do not need any of that.** They import no `woof`
at all; they drive Rust binaries.

---

## Assets you must supply

There is **no fetch path in woof hex for any of these**. No `woof hex fetch`
command exists. If a document ever implies otherwise, it is wrong.

**1. A mesh grid file** (`x1.2562.grid.nc`, `x4.163842.grid.nc`, …). Meshes
come from the MPAS-Atmosphere project's published mesh downloads, from the
`MPAS-Tools` mesh generator, or from the engine's own `woof mesh` door, which
generates an icosahedral Goldberg grid **and its matching static** for a named
refinement region, sized against the measured footprint of a named card.
woof hex reads and validates meshes and registers a new pair as table work;
the generator lives in `woof`.

**2. A matching static file** (`*.static.nc`) carrying terrain, land use, soil
category and vegetation interpolated onto that mesh. Static files are produced
by native `init_atmosphere_model`, or by the engine's `rw_mpas_static` (the
same writer `woof mesh` drives, against a WPS geographical dataset).
woof hex does not build static files itself. The grid and static must be the
same mesh: the doors cross-check `nCells` and refuse a mismatched pair by
name.

**3. For the init door: a vertical grid, one of two ways.** The Rust init
engine does not invent the vertical grid.

- **Native-free (the normal path):** pass `--vertical-spec` with a
  `gpuwm-hex.vertical-spec/v1` JSON declaration; the door constructs the
  v8.4.1 vertical contract itself and writes a durable vertical artifact with
  its receipt. No native file is read. A new vertical configuration is a JSON
  file, not a code branch. Measured against a native golden on 2026-08-24: the
  mint is schema-complete (134/134 variables), the constructed vertical sits
  within 3.9 mm of native `zgrid` with the per-field cost quantified, and the
  minted init runs the dycore; boundary in
  [`docs/native-free-init-admission.md`](docs/native-free-init-admission.md).
- **Native-capsule compatibility mode:** pass `--capsule`/`--reference` naming
  a native-minted init-class file; the door reads `zgrid, zz, fzm, fzp, dzu,
  rdzw, zb, zb3` and the smoothed terrain out of it and asserts the capsule's
  `zgrid` bit-identical against the reference before trusting a single level.

The two modes are mutually exclusive and there is no hidden native read.

**4. Meteorological input**: a WPS intermediate file from `ungrib` (GFS, ERA5,
whatever you drive with).

### Getting the Rust engines

Both doors are orchestration only; the field data is handled entirely by Rust
binaries built from the `woof` source tree. Nothing compiled ships inside this
wheel, so the binaries are staged onto your machine one of two ways.

**The short way.** `woof` publishes prebuilt bundles, and one command stages
the whole set: `rw_mpas_mesh`, `rw_mpas_static`, `rw_mpas_init`,
`rw_mpas_convert` and `rw_wrfbatch`:

```sh
woof fetch-bridges
```

It writes into `~/.woof/bridges`, which woof hex reads directly. No
environment variables to set. This works wherever a bundle is published for
your platform; `woof hex doctor` tells you whether it worked.

**The build.** On a platform with no published bundle, build from a checkout:

```sh
cd <woof checkout>/tools/rustwx
cargo build --release --offline --locked -p rw-mpas       # rw_mpas_init, rw_mpas_convert
cargo build --release --offline --locked -p rw-wrfbatch   # rw_wrfbatch
```

Then point the doors at what you built:

```sh
export WOOF_HEX_RW_MPAS_INIT=<woof>/tools/rustwx/target/release/rw_mpas_init
export WOOF_HEX_RW_MPAS_CONVERT=<woof>/tools/rustwx/target/release/rw_mpas_convert
export WOOF_HEX_RW_WRFBATCH=<woof>/tools/rustwx/target/release/rw_wrfbatch
```

#### The resolution ladder

Every door resolves every engine the same way, best first:

1. the door's own flag (`--engine`, `--convert-exe`, `--renderer-exe`);
2. this distribution's variable, then any older spelling it has carried:
   `RW_MPAS_INIT`, `MPAS_PORT_RW_MPAS_CONVERT` and `MPAS_PORT_RW_WRFBATCH`
   still work and always will, because a rename must never invalidate an
   install line that already works;
3. `woof`'s own variable (`WOOF_RW_MPAS_INIT` and siblings) and its bridge
   directories, which is where `woof fetch-bridges` stages;
4. `PATH`.

A flag or an environment variable naming a missing file is a **hard error**,
never a fall through to the next rung: a ladder that silently skips a broken
setting runs the wrong engine build and reports success. When nothing is
found, the refusal names every rung it searched and both commands above.

#### What `woof fetch-bridges` can and cannot supply today

Measured against the **published** `woof` 2.5.2 wheel, not a checkout: its
bundle carries `rw_wrfbatch` and **not** `rw_mpas_init` or `rw_mpas_convert`.
On that engine `woof fetch-bridges` gives you the renderer and nothing that
opens either MPAS door. That measurement is why the dependency floor cleared
2.5.3 and never fell back: 2.5.3 is where the four MPAS bridge binaries
enter the bundle, and the current `woof>=2.8.0,<2.9` range keeps that
guarantee, so pip cannot resolve you onto an engine that strands both doors. A
conforming install therefore never sees the 2.5.2 shortfall; it is recorded
here because it is the reason the floor first moved.

You are not asked to track that. `woof hex doctor` asks the woof you
actually have which artifacts its bundle declares, and every refusal offers
the staging command only when it can really deliver the file: a remedy that
cannot work is worse than no remedy, because you run it, it succeeds, and the
door still refuses.

---

## Door 1: `woof hex init`

Build initial conditions without native Fortran `init_atmosphere_model`.

```sh
woof hex init \
  --met        WORK/MET:2025-03-14_12 \
  --static     assets/x4.163842.static.nc \
  --grid       assets/x4.163842.grid.nc \
  --vertical-spec verification/vertical-specs/tc55-v1.json \
  --out        run/init.nc \
  --start-time 2025-03-14_12:00:00 \
  --nfglevels 38 --nfgsoillevels 4 \
  --extrap-airtemp lapse-rate --use-spechumd no \
  --theta-adv-order 3 --coef-3rd-order 0.25 \
  --virtual-factor reproduce-fortran \
  --deep-soil-moisture reproduce-fortran \
  --landuse-table MODIFIED_IGBP_MODIS_NOAH \
  --frac-seaice yes --tsk-seaice-threshold 100.0 \
  --oned-underflow preserve
```

Writes `run/init.nc` and `run/init.nc.provenance.json` (SHA-256 of every input,
the engine binary, the argv, the engine's own receipt and the output), prints a
JSON summary, exits 0.

**Every physics switch is required and has no default.** That is deliberate:
each one changes the numbers in a file that opens cleanly and reads plausibly
either way, so a default would be a silent wrong answer. Each refusal prints the
native namelist key it corresponds to, so a captured `namelist.init_atmosphere`
transcribes without guessing. Full detail, including the sixteen named refusals:
[`docs/init-door.md`](docs/init-door.md).

What the door accepts is not a promise but a measured table:
[`docs/source-matrix.md`](docs/source-matrix.md) drives every source in the
RW-WPS registry with real bytes through intermediate, init and a
five-composite-step forecast, and records one verdict per source, a green
run with receipts, or the chain's refusal, verbatim.

`--vertical-spec` is the native-free path (see *Assets you must supply* and
[`docs/native-free-init-admission.md`](docs/native-free-init-admission.md));
`--capsule`/`--reference` with a native-minted init file is the compatibility
mode. The two are mutually exclusive.

## Door 2: `woof hex render`

History in, product PNGs out, entirely through the Rust path.

```sh
woof hex render \
  --history history.2025-03-15_00.00.00.nc \
  --mesh    assets/x4.163842.grid.nc \
  --out     ./png \
  --simulation-start 2025-03-14_12:00:00 \
  --products all
```

`rw_mpas_convert` resamples each history frame onto a render window and
`rw_wrfbatch` draws the products. PNGs are filed at render time into
`<out>/<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/`, never flat, with a
`render-manifest.json` beside the tree carrying engine digests, per-frame
results and the exact invocations. Scratch lives in a sibling of `--out`, never
inside it, and is deleted after a clean run.

There is no fallback plotter. If the Rust renderer is absent the door refuses by
name; it never draws a weather field in Python. Full detail:
[`docs/render-door.md`](docs/render-door.md).

## Three smaller doors

`woof hex mesh-check --grid <grid> --static <static>` validates a mesh pair
before anything expensive touches it, and refuses a defective pair by name.
`woof hex oracle-gate` replays the source-extracted Fortran fixtures against
a mesh. `woof hex cull` cuts a limited-area grid, static and initial
condition out of a global case, which is what makes the regional lane cheap:
grid, static and init in about a second where a native regional init took
775 s. All three are listed by `woof hex --help`.

## The forecast lane

`woof hex forecast` is a door. It binds a registered mesh against its pinned
bytes, asks the card whether the run fits **before** the run starts, refuses
by name with numbers when it does not, and prints the render command when it
passes. `--preflight` gives the same answer without integrating anything.

It runs from an install. The drivers ship inside the package
(`woof/hex/drivers/`), and the physics seam is the installed `woof`, named in
the receipt by version and `RECORD` digest (*The engine*). Through 0.3.1
both were checkouts (a woof hex source checkout for the drivers under
`tools/` and a woof git clone for receipt provenance) so a wheel install
could not forecast at all. `tools/` keeps same-named entries for the three
drivers so older scripts keep working; they reach the packaged modules.

Its inputs are a mesh, a static file and an init. The registry makes the first
two table work; the init door makes the third. The card question is answered
from `woof.hex.device_admission`, on the 170 SM part the registered
40,962-cell mesh peaks at 8,874 MiB and the 163,842-cell x4 at 20,446 MiB,
which with that card's own margin puts x4 in practice on a 32 GiB card.

### Limited area, behind lateral boundary conditions

`--lbc-dir` runs the same full physics stack on a **culled** regional mesh
driven from its parent. A cull of a placed fine grid is around eleven times
fewer cells than the global refined mesh covering the same storm, and it runs
on a 10 GiB card. The outermost seven rings are boundary data driven from the
parent every step rather than the model's own answer, and products drawn over
the whole domain include them.

### A fine core at any point, from HRRR

`woof hex mesh-plan --point LAT,LON --fine-dx-m 937.5 --radius-km 100 --card 32gb`
writes the registered 937.5 m ladder spec centred on the point, prices the
global parent through the generator and the limited-area cull on the
admission surface's own row for the card, and with `--generate` builds the
pair, admits it, registers it as a RUNTIME ROW in `mesh-rows.json` beside the
mesh (never a checkout edit), cuts the cull and mints its vertical.
`woof hex intermediate --source hrrr` resamples HRRR onto the regular
lat-lon WPS intermediate the init and boundary engines read, through the
engine's own decoder and interpolation operator; `woof hex lbc` builds the
boundary series from the hourly intermediates. The whole chain, with what it
measured, is [`docs/hex-point-hrrr.md`](docs/hex-point-hrrr.md).

### Placement and cycling

`woof hex swath` decides where a fine grid should go: detection on
sea-level-reduced pressure, a declarative threat grammar, commensurable
ranking across phenomena that carry different units, and hysteresis so a grid
does not chase noise. `woof hex cycle` runs the loop: a coarse parent, the
corridors placed inside it, and the next cycle's re-detection. See
[`docs/cycle-door.md`](docs/cycle-door.md).

### Local time stepping, opt-in

On a variable-resolution mesh most columns are far coarser than the finest one,
and the acoustic sub-step is sized for the finest. `--local-timestep` lets a
coarse column take fewer, longer acoustic sub-steps, chosen from the grid
file's own `dcEdge`.

```bash
python src/hexcore/drivers/run_cuda_v841_forecast.py \
    --grid x4.163842.grid.nc --static x4.163842.static.nc \
    --init <init>.nc --hours 6 \
    --cache-root <cache> --output <out> \
    --local-timestep
```

`--local-timestep-rates` sets the ladder (default `1,3`, two classes) and
`--local-timestep-buffer-rings` the width of the finer-rate buffer around a
class boundary (default 1).

**It is off by default and that is deliberate.** Native MPAS-A v8.4.1 has no
local time stepping: `Registry.xml:64-68` offers SRK3 only, and `dt_dynamics`,
`rk_timestep`, `rk_sub_timestep` and `number_sub_steps` are scalars at
`mpas_atm_time_integration.F:2053-2092`. There is therefore no byte-identical
implementation and there never can be. A user who turns it on takes a declared
divergence from native; a user who does not gets the pinned arithmetic
unchanged, byte for byte. This is a performance feature, not a correctness
remedy, so opt-in is the correct shape for it.

Two things follow from the mesh rather than the flag:

- On a **quasi-uniform** mesh every column lands in one class, so the option is
  inert and the run is bit-identical to a default run. Measured on x1.40962:
  all 40,962 cells in class 0, zero interface edges, identity permutation, and
  every history frame SHA-256-identical.
- The ladder is not free. A rate must divide every RK stage's acoustic
  sub-step count, and the released `(1, 3, 6)` schedule admits `1` and `3`
  only: `2` and `4` do not divide the RK2 stage's three sub-steps.

Class boundaries are refluxed, so mass and passive water vapour are conserved
to binary32 rounding rather than exactly; see *Local time stepping is
flux-conservative, not exactly conservative* under **Limitations**. A run with
the option on stays bit-reproducible run to run, so the dual-run byte
comparison that screens for memory corruption on cards without ECC still
works.

#### What it costs, measured

**On the published x4.163842 mesh the option does not pay, and the ceiling
says it cannot.** Dry lane, 163,842 columns, 55 levels, RTX 5070 Ti, one model
hour:

| | wall seconds per model step |
|---|---|
| default path | 1.268 |
| `--local-timestep` | 1.283 |

0.988x: about 1% slower. The reason is measurable rather than mysterious.
Re-timing the same arm at 12 acoustic sub-steps instead of 6 gives the cost of
one sub-step directly, and from it **the acoustic loop is 23.5% of a model
step**. This mesh admits a 23.0% acoustic saving, so the best a whole step
could do is **1.057x** before the option pays for its own bookkeeping, and the
bookkeeping is larger than that.

The ceiling is a property of the released schedule, not of this mesh. A rate
must divide every stage's sub-step count, so `(1, 3, 6)` admits only rate 3,
and a rate-3 column still runs 4 of the 10 sub-steps a fine column runs. Even
in the limit where **every** column is coarse the saving is 60% of the acoustic
loop, which at a 23.5% share is **1.16x for the whole step**. That number is
the real cap on this feature as the port stands.

What would move it: a mesh with a much steeper resolution gradient (the
generated 15 km-in-136 km box mesh classes to a 49.7% acoustic saving, a 1.13x
ceiling), and an acoustic schedule whose sub-step counts admit a rate above 3.

#### On a limited-area cull, measured 2026-09-14

On the culls the doors make the option is inert by construction: `mesh-plan`
cuts at 1.35 times the fine radius and the cull door cuts a cap, so the cells
whose spacing reaches three times the finest edge all sit in the seven driven
boundary rings, every driven cell is held at rate 1, and the one-cell buffer
demotes the rest. Measured on the RTX 5090 (point cull, 43,884 cells x 55
levels, HRRR-driven, 1 h): `--local-timestep` executes one class and both
history frames are byte-identical to the default run, at 0.992x the step
(inside run-to-run noise). Forcing an interface into the interior with the
`tools/lts_forced_classing.py` instrument (6,206 cells at rate 3, 1,456
interface edges, an 8.5 % arithmetic acoustic saving) makes the step 1.071x
SLOWER: every dycore kernel on a mesh this size runs in one wave on the card,
so the fine class costs what the whole mesh costs and each coarse-class
launch is a further wave. The corridor cull (40,520 cells, GFS-driven) gives
the same numbers (0.989x, 1.068x). What the forced interface does to the
fields is in [`docs/local-timestep-lam.md`](docs/local-timestep-lam.md).

#### The full-step form, measured to a no-go

The stronger form of this feature (every dycore kernel launched per rate
class, whole RK steps advancing at `rate * dt`) is not capped by the acoustic
share. Its arithmetic prize on real meshes is large: counting cell-steps under
a `(1,2,4)` ladder with one buffer ring, the published x4.163842 mesh admits
**1.47x** and the generated 15 km-in-136 km box mesh **2.73x**. Whether the
card can collect that prize is a question about launch cost: a kernel launched
over a class must cost proportionally less than a launch over the whole mesh,
and below the card's occupancy knee it does not.

`tools/probe_lts_fullstep_projection.py` measured it (RTX 5070 Ti, the port's
own pinned kernels and their landed index-list derivations, the real meshes'
own class index lists):

| mesh | cells | arithmetic prize | measured projection |
|---|---|---|---|
| x1.40962 uniform | 40,962 | 1.000x | 1.000x |
| x4.163842 published VR | 163,842 | 1.467x | **1.254x** |
| 15 km-in-136 km box | 38,857 | 2.725x | **0.979x** |

The uniform row is the instrument's known-answer: one class, and the
index-list launch prices within 0.2% of the pinned kernel. On the box mesh the
prize inverts into a projected slowdown because the whole mesh is already
below the occupancy knee (doubling its cells costs only 1.26–1.30x on the
cell kernels) so a launch over its 5,562-cell fine class costs nearly what
the whole mesh costs, and the fine class launches four times per macro step.
The steeper the refinement, the smaller the classes, the harder the floor
bites: `(1,2,4,8)` projects worse (0.904x), not better. Only the x4-size mesh
keeps every class above the knee, and even there the trio projects 1.254x
**before** interface bookkeeping; the shipped acoustic form measured its own
bookkeeping at about 7% of a step on that mesh, and the full-step form pays a
cost of the same character plus time interpolation at class boundaries.

So the verdict, measured rather than estimated: rebuilding the whole step
loop per class would buy roughly 1.1–1.2x on the one registered mesh large
enough to profit, and a slowdown on the small steep meshes the prize was
supposed to come from. Not worth a rewrite of every kernel's launch path.
What could reopen it: meshes an order of magnitude larger, where every class
sits above the occupancy knee, or overlapping different classes' independent
work in concurrent streams, neither is measured here, and the probe is the
instrument to re-run when either becomes real.

### The surface/PBL cadence, selectable

`config_bldt_seconds` is welded to `config_dt` by default: the surface layer,
the land-surface model and the PBL are called on every model step, as the
native x4 v8.4.1 reference ran them. At the 120 s that reference used that is
30 calls an hour; at the 5 s a sub-kilometre mesh declares it is 720, and the
per-step profile of 2026-09-13 (RTX 5090, the 43,884-cell point mesh) put the
seam's surface/PBL phase at a fifth of every step.

`--pbl-cadence SECONDS` calls the stack once every `SECONDS / dt` steps and
holds the tendency it produced on the steps between -- the engine's own
positive-`bldt` path, ARW's `stepbl`: the held rate is applied unchanged on
every non-due step, and the surface layer and land-surface model integrate
their own state with the cadence as their step. Radiation keeps its own
600 s cadence either way; it was never welded to `dt`.

```bash
woof hex forecast --mesh <row> ... --pbl-cadence 60
```

**It changes the forecast, so it is selectable and never silently the
default.** `auto` is the weld and changes no run. An explicit cadence records
itself as `source: "explicit"` in the run receipt with its calls per hour and
the steps held between calls, and the driver receipt carries the seam's own
count of due and held steps against the count the declared cadence predicts
(`physics.cadence` in `forecast-receipt.json`), so a held arm that reproduced
the welded arm exactly would be caught by its own receipt.

Three refusals, each by name and before any card is touched: a cadence that
is not a whole number of steps (the message names both numbers, the multiples
of `dt` on either side and `auto`; nothing is rounded), a request that is not
a number of seconds, and a held cadence at a timestep whose welded
configuration holds no anchor. A held cadence at an anchored `(dt, cumulus)`
is admitted through a row *derived* from the welded anchor: the outer step,
its RK schedule, its clock and its byte-identical dual run are properties of
the timestep and are the welded row's own; the physics band is stamped NOT
MEASURED at the held cadence rather than borrowed, and the receipt says which
welded row the admission came from (`surface_pbl_anchor_derived_from`).

The measurement of record is in `docs/hex-point-hrrr.md`: the every-step
arm against 30, 60 and 120 s on the point mesh (43,884 cells, dt 5 s, HRRR
15Z, RTX 5090, one session). Every held cadence buys the same five per cent
per step (median composite step 0.2994 s to 0.2842 to 0.2845 s) and every
one changes the one-hour forecast well past the 2.6.5 to 2.7.3 seam
movement (theta up to 1.25 K at 30 s, 2.95 K at 120 s, against 0.139 K), so
none qualified as the default and the weld stays. This tree at `auto` wrote
history byte-identical to the untouched tree's.

### Forecast presets

`woof hex forecast --preset NAME` selects a row of `woof.hex.forecast_preset`;
the door turns the row into the cadence knob above, so a preset is data and
adding one is adding a row. `reference`, the default, is the proven
configuration. `fast` holds the surface/PBL stack for up to 30 s between calls
(six steps at dt 5 s). An explicit `--pbl-cadence` wins, and the receipt says
which decided.

Graded against observations (MRMS reflectivity, Stage-IV hourly
precipitation, ASOS 2 m temperature, dewpoint and 10 m wind) on four 3 h
HRRR-driven forecasts of the point cull, `fast` took about 6 per cent less
time per step and scored the same on reflectivity and precipitation
thresholds, and it forecast 10 m wind worse on all four cases and 2 m
dewpoint and temperature worse on three. So `reference` stays the default and
`fast` is there for when time matters more than the near-surface forecast.
The same measurement is in `docs/hex-point-hrrr.md`.

## Limitations

Read these before trusting a number.

### The GF convection scheme is a different generation from native

**Declared, measured, and not a defect in the seam.** The seam-level non-parity
was closed: the four auxiliary forcing lanes, shallow-on, and per-cell `dx` all
reach the scheme the way native feeds them. What remains is that the port's
Grell-Freitas body is **WRF v4.6.1's Freitas-2018 generation**, while MPAS
v8.4.1's `module_cu_gf.mpas.F` is the **2013 ensemble fork**. Verified by source
count on both sides:

- native has zero occurrences of `dicycle` and zero of `tau_ecmwf`: those
  closures do not exist in it at all;
- native carries Fritsch-Chappell `AA0/1200s` closure members the port does not;
- native runs `c0=.002`; the port runs a temperature-scaled `c0=.004`;
- native's shallow scheme is non-precipitating (`c0=0`); the port's shallow
  scheme folds `prets` into `pratec`.

Closing this means porting native's `cup_gf`/`cup_gf_sh` bodies. That is a
program, not a seam edit, and whether it should close is the referee's call.
Every run receipt carries `gf_native_parity_claim: false` next to
`gf_declared_divergence` naming exactly the above, and so does every history
file written. The field stopped being called a blocker when parity was
retired as a goal: this is a declared property of the product, judged by
obs-skill.

### Local time stepping is flux-conservative, not exactly conservative

**Only reachable with `--local-timestep`, which is off by default.** When two
neighbouring columns advance on different acoustic sub-steps, the mass each
carries across the edge between them is integrated at two different rates and
the two no longer cancel. Mass is then created or destroyed at every class
boundary, and that is what kills local time stepping in practice.

The remedy here is Berger-Colella refluxing on the acoustic mass flux: the
coarse column keeps predicting with its own sub-step, the interface edge
accumulates the fine-rate integral minus that prediction, and the residual is
handed to the coarse column at the end of the RK stage. No term is dropped and
none is double counted, so the statement is **conservative in the flux and
approximate at binary32 rounding**: the coarse side applies one rounded sum
where the fine side applied a sequence of rounded increments.

Measured, not asserted. Dry lane, water vapour a passive scalar, published
x4.163842 variable-resolution mesh (5.46 max/min spacing, 1,063 interface
edges), one model hour:

| arm | dry-mass drift | passive-qv drift |
|---|---|---|
| default | 3.09e-11 | 9.02e-10 |
| `--local-timestep` | 2.58e-11 | 6.36e-10 |

against a 2.0e-8 bound. A full-physics qv budget cannot decide this: water
vapour there has sources and sinks and drifts about 1.8e-4 over six minutes
from the microphysics alone.

### Three bias-shaped differences against native: declared divergences

Not blockers, and not evidence of a broken dycore. They are the measured price
of running WOOF's physics instead of MPAS's, stated so a user knows what they
are getting. The obs-skill comparison, which is the verification of record for
physics here, ran on 2026-08-25 and reaches two of the three; the register of
all three (the mechanism, the magnitude, the named observational referee and
now what that referee said) is
[`docs/declared-divergences.md`](docs/declared-divergences.md).

Measured over 24 h, two independent weather cases, two mixing regimes,
163,842-cell mesh, cell-aligned with no interpolation.

**When, exactly, because these three magnitudes carry no date of their own.**
They entered this repository already finished on 2026-08-20, and there is no
receipt directory, no card and no run commit for them anywhere in the tree.
What can be established is a ceiling: the commit that introduced them pinned
engine `629ddb6f0`, so they were measured at or before that pin. Ten engine
pin moves have landed since: `0d04db712` (2026-08-24), `26daaab7e`
(2026-08-25), `659962929` (2026-08-28), `7e34a48` (2026-08-31, woof
`2.6.0`), `df5f34c5c` (2026-09-01, woof 2.6.1), `636ab1b4b`
(2026-09-02, woof 2.6.3), `d60b883e7` (2026-09-02, woof 2.6.4),
`a7785421e` (2026-09-13, woof 2.7.3), `ed957997f` (2026-09-15, woof
2.7.4) and `0164ae0f2` (2026-09-29, woof 2.8.0). The **2.5.8** move is measured to change nothing: a four-arm byte A/B
on one card found the old and new pins identical on the atmosphere half of
the per-step fingerprint at all 31 steps and on 0 of 138 history variables, one mesh, one case, one hour. The
**2.6.0** move also crosses the executed seam (`woof/core/rrtmg_legacy.py`
among its three moved files) and is measured the same way at the same
scope: the x4 proof re-run at that pin wrote an F001 history byte-identical
to the 2.5.8 proof's. The
**2.6.1** move crosses it a third time, at its centre (the seam's own batch
driver `woof/core/mpas_column_batch.py` gains restart schema v2 and the P3
eight-species transport) and is measured the same way at the same scope:
the x4 proof re-run at that pin wrote all four snapshots (F000, F030, F001
and the restarted F001) byte-identical to the 2.6.0 proof's, so one F001
SHA-256 now spans three engines.
The **2.6.3** move touches the same batch driver (the aerosol-aware Thompson
species row) plus a config-relative file key off the physics path; its
one-hour byte arm was not run separately: the 2.6.4 arm below, taken
ninety minutes after that pin was superseded, covers it by inclusion. The
**2.6.4** move crosses the executed seam more widely than any since 2.5.8:
six of the sixteen pinned files moved between the two published wheels,
among them the phase-one driver `woof/core/physics.py` (the cumulus adapter
contract grew for a third cumulus scheme), the Grell-Freitas adapter
`woof/core/gf.py` and its kernel source `woof/core/kernels/gf.cu` (the
glibc float32 words moved into a header the loader prepends), the kernel
loader, the config loader and the restart identity table; the column batch
and the contract document did not move. Its one-hour byte arm is the x4
frozen-source proof re-run at the 2.6.4 pins: all four snapshots (F000, F030,
F001 and the restarted F001) byte-identical to the 2.6.1 proof's, so one
F001 SHA-256 now spans 2.5.8, 2.6.0, 2.6.1 and 2.6.4. The published
**2.6.5** moved none of the sixteen pinned files, so it is admitted
by the range without a pin move and the 2.6.4 arm covers it.
The **2.7.3** move (2026-09-13) crosses the executed seam more widely than
any before it (eleven of the sixteen pinned files moved between the
published 2.6.5 and 2.7.3 wheels) and it is the first move since 2.5.8
with **no x4 byte arm**: the re-pin was taken on a 16 GiB card holding none
of the pinned x4 assets, so whether the F001 SHA-256 that spans 2.5.8
through 2.6.5 survives it is **NOT MEASURED**, and given what follows it is
not expected to. What was measured instead is the seam itself, engine
against engine on fixed columns (`tools/measure_engine_seam_ab.py`,
receipts `verification/engine-verdicts/seam-ab-*.json`: one card, eight
columns, forty levels, twenty 120 s steps, WSM6, YSU, Noah-MP and legacy
RRTMG, with Grell-Freitas on one arm and off on the other). Two things
move. (1) **Grell-Freitas**, in the pinned `woof/core/kernels/gf.cu`: the
glibc `tgammaf` transcription is gone and the mass-flux shape normalisation
`fzu` now uses the engine's own correctly rounded gamma (the engine's own
figures: `fzu` moves by up to 4 ULP on 21 of the 26 (alpha, beta) pairs its
fixture reaches, and `xmb` moves by up to 7.3 per cent per ULP of `fzu`
through the closure), and the cloud-work integral's level loop now includes
the `kbcon` layer. On the convective profile, where GF fires on every
column, the convective rain bucket differs by up to 5.1e-4 mm after forty
minutes (0.21 per cent of the 0.245 mm the largest column accumulated), the
phase-one theta rate by up to 2.9e-5 K/s (8.7 per cent of the largest
rate), the vapour rate by up to 7.8e-8 kg/kg/s (15 per cent), and after
forty minutes theta by up to 9.4e-3 K and qv by 2.3e-5 kg/kg; with cumulus
off the same columns are byte-identical between the two engines on all 500
arrays captured. (2) **YSU**, in `woof/core/kernels/ysu.cu`, a file the
sixteen-file manifest has never pinned: a column whose first-guess
boundary-layer top sits below the second model level now stays in the
local-K regime for the whole step, and the post-scan clamp is WRF's two
independent statements, so a theta-li revival with `kpbl == 1` no longer
survives (the engine's reading of `bl_ysu.F90:703-728` and `:765-766`). On
the capped profile, where GF never fires and the two arms are
byte-identical, the lowest three levels move on five of eight columns from
step 7 on: the u rate by up to 1.9e-4 m/s² (55 per cent of the largest
rate), the theta rate by up to 1.8e-4 K/s (43 per cent), the vapour rate by
up to 5.6e-7 kg/kg/s, and after forty minutes theta by up to 0.139 K and qv
by 3.7e-4 kg/kg. That attribution is exact rather than inferred: 2.6.5 with
only that one kernel replaced by 2.7.3's is byte-identical to 2.7.3 on all
500 arrays of that profile. Both are the engine's changes, carried through
the seam without alteration; the port's physics is judged against
observations, not against the previous engine, and a pinned-file manifest
that does not reach the boundary-layer kernel is a named follow-up rather
than a claim this page makes.
The **2.7.4** move (2026-09-15) is the narrowest since 2.6.5 (two of the
sixteen pinned files moved between the published 2.7.3 and 2.7.4 wheels,
one added settings-map reader in the config loader and two keyword
arguments on the classic Thompson path, neither on the port's executed
path) and it is measured byte-neutral through the seam: the seam-level
A/B is 500 of 500 arrays identical on both profiles and both arms on two
cards, and the one-hour point-cull forecast under 2.7.4 wrote both history
frames byte-identical to the 2.7.3 frames of record on an RTX 5090,
with the cull's contract deck 8 of 8 bitwise at the unchanged kernel-set
digest (`docs/declared-divergences.md`). Nothing is declared for it.
The **2.8.0** move (2026-09-29) moved eight of the sixteen pinned files,
none of them the column batch, the seam document or a Noah-MP file, and it
is measured byte-neutral through the seam at the same three scopes: the
seam-level A/B is 500 of 500 arrays identical on both profiles and both
arms, a 10-minute forecast on a 12,795-cell 937.5 m point cull wrote both
history frames byte-identical under 2.7.4 and 2.8.0, and the cull's
contract deck is 8 of 8 bitwise at the unchanged kernel-set digest, all on
an RTX 5090 (`docs/declared-divergences.md`). Nothing is declared for it.
The two earliest moves have no such arm, and none of the three magnitudes
has been re-measured over 24 h since. Whether any of them moved is **NOT MEASURED**.
Read them as the numbers from the pre-2026-08-20 engine, not as today's.

1. **Upper-level warm drift.** Above level 45 the port warms relative to native
   at **+0.019 K/h, near-linear, one-signed**, reaching **+0.46 K at 24 h**,
   and it is identical in both weather cases and both mixing regimes. Case
   independence means it is a code path, not weather. The legacy-RRTMG radiation
   lane is the prime suspect. Fine at 24 h; extrapolated (not measured) a 7-day
   run carries about +3.2 K of stratospheric error, which disqualifies this
   version for long-range work.
2. **Convective-to-explicit precipitation repartition.** The port's GF produces
   about **a third less convective rain** (`rainc` -36 % / -34 % in the two
   cases); explicit microphysics makes up roughly half of it (`rainnc`
   +29 % / +25 %); **net domain-mean precipitation runs about 15 % dry against
   native MPAS-A**. This is the whole-model price of the declared GF
   generation gap above, quantified.

   **That number belongs to the retired referee, and the live one returned the
   opposite sign.** "15 % dry" is a global domain mean against native MPAS-A,
   and physics parity with native was retired as a goal on 2026-08-20. The
   verification of record is skill against observations; it ran on 2026-08-25
   against NCEP/EMC Stage-IV hourly QPE over a CONUS window and found the port
   **wet in all four cases** (paired case-block estimate **+0.0247 mm/h**,
   95 % interval **[+0.0041, +0.0606]**, 5,000 replicates) with the frequency
   bias at 1 mm/h above one in three of the four (1.59 / 1.35 / 1.38 / 0.77),
   so it rains over too much area rather than too little.

   **Read the obs result with its own limits: four cases is not a skill
   assessment.** Two of the four are the divergence cases themselves. One
   truncated at 23 h and carries the largest bias, +56.9 %. One is +41.5 % on
   almost no rain: 0.0156 against 0.0110 mm/h, an absolute difference of
   +0.0046 mm/h. The two clean, complete cases are +9.8 % and +2.4 %. Neither
   verdict cancels the other, because they are not the same domain or the same
   statistic: one is a global mean against a model, the other a CONUS window
   against gauge-and-radar analysis. What is settled is that being drier than
   native does not mean being drier than the atmosphere.
3. **Downstream condensate surplus.** With more rain made explicitly, the port
   carries **+50 % cloud water and +62 % rain water** in the domain mean by
   24 h, with much heavier point extrema (max-cell 24 h precipitation 502 vs
   308 mm). Probably a consequence of (2); it should be re-measured after any GF
   fix before anyone touches microphysics.

Everything else in the comparison is chaos-shaped: symmetric, growing with lead
time, driven by convective cells landing in different places, with envelope
statistics that match (peak updraft 11.49 vs 11.26 m/s; domain means within
0.05 %). That shape is expected between a single-precision CPU model and a CUDA
port and proves nothing wrong. The three above are one-signed and
case-independent, which chaos cannot be, and each names a lane to fix.

The lane runs, and these are its edges rather than its promises.

- **One parent, windowed.** A cycle is one parent integration read at
  successive times, not a parent regenerated per cycle. Regenerating it is the
  operational remedy for a corridor that has moved far, and it is not built.
- **Two of four admitted slots per cycle** are skipped as background culls by
  a measured minimum-edge-length ratio, so a cycle can place fewer corridors
  than it detected.
- **Hour zero has no ice.** A corridor started from transplanted parent state
  begins with no cloud ice, snow or graupel, because the initial-condition
  stream carries no slot for them. Reflectivity does not correlate at hour
  zero; one hour on, the microphysics has re-formed the ice and r = 0.863.
  Temperature agrees to five decimals throughout.
- **No obs-skill score on a cycled case.** The limited-area verdicts above are
  against a global run over the same ground, not against observations.

### Other

- **Multi-GPU is built and proven but not shipped** (two-node, bitwise
  partition-invariant, 1.23x on 25 GbE). There is no door on it, and it has
  not been re-proven at the current engine pin.
- **A case has been seen to refuse mid-run** on a vertical-velocity divergence
  at levels 44-47. The refusal is the model declining to publish a step it does
  not trust, which is the designed behaviour, but it means a given case can stop
  early rather than produce a bad forecast.
## Licence and derivation

woof hex is **Apache-2.0**, the same licence woof ships under.

It reimplements the dynamical core of MPAS-Atmosphere v8.4.1 (LANL/UCAR) for
CUDA devices, with pinned source-line citations. That upstream is BSD-3-Clause,
whose terms govern the MPAS-derived portions and travel with every copy of this
one: `NOTICE` reproduces the MPAS licence in full and carries the marking it
requires of derivative works. `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` both ship inside the wheel
and the sdist.

This is **not** the version available from LANS and UCAR, and neither they nor
their contributors endorse it. Results from woof hex are not results from
MPAS-Atmosphere; where the two are known to differ, the differences are the
measured ones stated above.

## Development

Tests run from this directory:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest tests -q
```

Three tiers gate themselves and each names why it is skipping: see
[`tools/battery/README.md`](tools/battery/README.md) for what each covers and
how to run the gated ones:

| tier | selector | needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unit + packaging | `-m "not gpu and not bigcard and not assets"` | nothing but Python |
| assets | `-m assets` | about 6.9 GiB of byte-pinned mesh/static/init/native-history files |
| big card | `-m bigcard` | a CUDA device clearing the measured x4 floor: about 21.7 GiB free (the measured 20,446 MiB peak plus that card's own margin, computed by `woof.hex.device_admission`; re-fitted at the merged tip 2026-08-26 and re-shaped 2026-08-27) |

`WOOF_HEX_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1` (or `GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`, honoured so a box
configured for the engine behaves the same) bans device contact outright.
