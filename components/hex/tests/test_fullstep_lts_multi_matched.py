"""The multi-card LTS executor carries the matched interface flux the one-card executor has.

Breakage this prevents: without it the coarse/fine interface is the reflux-driven instability
f3e284e/d5b1024 cured on one card.  On the 3 km Kalmaegi start member (2026-10-13) two cards
reached max|w| 47 m/s by 450 s and the validation flag refused the step on every block layout,
exactly as one card with interface_flux="own" did, while one card with the matched flux ran clean.
