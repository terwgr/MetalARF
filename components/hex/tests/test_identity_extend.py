"""Bitwise native identity of the v8.4 scalar transport on a moist case.

The fixture is a native MPAS-A v8.4.2 GNU strict one-step run that also wrote
ruAvg and wwAvg (tools/native_dry_reference/run_native_case.sh with
EXTRA_STREAM_VARS="ruAvg wwAvg") plus the init it started from. With the
v8.2.3 vertical upwind association this replay differs from native in 43,513
of 2,252,910 qv words on the x1.40962 real-terrain case; with native's v8.4
order it differs in none. No tolerance: every 32-bit word must match.
