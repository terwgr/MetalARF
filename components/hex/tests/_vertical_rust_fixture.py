"""Use the delivered rw-mpas engine for vertical consumer regression tests.

The pool's installed geometry bridge predates hex-vertical-v1.  These tests
exercise this lane's bridge, so their executable travels with the tests rather
than depending on an integrator-owned installation being updated first.
There is no mocked arithmetic or production engine-resolution change.
