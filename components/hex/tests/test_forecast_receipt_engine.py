"""The forecast receipt names the engine the run's seam bytes matched.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: through 0.3.1 the receipt's top-level
``arwen_commit`` and glacier digest restated the x4 proof's own sealed
constants, so every forecast receipt named an engine commit older than the
one the run executed.  ``measured_engine_identity`` reads them from the
identity the seam bytes match, the one the adapter itself records.
