"""A device command's exit runs threading's exit hooks before atexit, so no pool worker holds it.

THE BREAKAGE (the hl-3 headline run, 2026-10-24): device_process_exit ran atexit alone and then os._exit.
threading's hooks never ran, so concurrent.futures never stopped the kernel plan's spawn compile pool,
and multiprocessing's exit function joined its idle worker: the finished forecast never exited.
