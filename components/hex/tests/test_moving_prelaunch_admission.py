"""A pre-launched move segment defers its device admission until the carrier is sealed.

Breakage prevented: at 470k cells the member being replaced holds ~54 GB of a 96 GB card, so the
next member's process, started early to overlap its host preparation, was refused by admission on
every move and each move fell back to a cold launch.  The decision is taken again once the carrier
exists; it still refuses if the card never frees.
