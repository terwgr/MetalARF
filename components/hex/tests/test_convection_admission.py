"""Convection admission: the scheme is OFF below 3 km, by default.

It was ruled on 2026-08-26 that convection is switched off below 3 km,
answering directly whether a fine swath runs the cumulus scheme at all.
This is that ruling, made executable.

**Why it is a gate and not a preference.**  THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS,
MEASURED (2026-08-26, `evidence/dt-anchors-20260826/RECEIPT.md`): WRF pins
``cudt = 0`` for ``cu_physics = 3``, so Grell-Freitas recomputes every
model step and no configuration relaxes it.  A 5 s timestep therefore calls
the closure 720 times an hour against the 30 the lane was proven at, and the
5 s anchor measured a |w| mean climbing 12.0 / 49.6 / 73.5 / 87.5 m/s over
four half-hour windows against a 120 s control's 1.15 / 1.17 / 1.20 / 1.48,
with |w| max 102.67 against 1.680.  A 3 km swath declares 20 s and a 750 m
swath declares 5 s, so every mesh the ruling covers runs the closure at
between six and twenty-four times its proven call rate.

**Fixed means default.**  A bare run on a sub-3-km mesh must stop calling
the scheme with nobody passing a flag; the explicit ``--convection`` switch
exists to run A/B arms (that is how the attribution above was measured),
never as the remedy.

**Convection-off is a NEW admitted configuration, not a mutation of the
proven one.**  The frozen v8.4.1 column-physics lane's proven configuration
stays exactly reachable and exactly refusing: how often a scheme is called
is part of what an anchor certifies, so a convection-off run earns its own
anchors and cannot borrow the GF rows'.

Everything here runs on a CPU-only box.

    """The ruling decides each row from its own spacing, and nothing else.

    THIS TEST WAS RE-READ ON 2026-08-29, NOT RELAXED, and its own former
    message is why.  It used to assert that the FINEST registered mesh is at
    or above the 3,000 m threshold -- true when it was written (finest
    15,000 m) and still true at 4,000 m -- and it printed the instruction for
    the day that stopped holding: "a row finer than the threshold is now
    registered; the ruling fires on it, and this test should be re-read
    rather than relaxed".

    That day is here: ``v0.9.120.110533`` declares 937.5 m.  So the claim the
    test protects is restated as what it always meant -- every row gets the
    scheme ITS OWN spacing selects -- and it now checks BOTH sides, which is
    strictly more than the single-sided version could:

    * every row at or above the threshold still selects Grell-Freitas, so
      nothing that was registered before this ruling moved; and
    * every row below it selects no cumulus scheme at all, so the ruling
      actually fires rather than being a threshold nobody crosses.

    Keyed on the threshold rather than on a list of names, so the next
    sub-kilometre row is absorbed without editing this test again.
