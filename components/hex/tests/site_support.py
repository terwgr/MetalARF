"""What the tests need from outside a checkout, where they look for it, and how to fetch it.

A public checkout carries no MPAS source tree, no native forecast publications
and no proof-lane receipts.  A test that compares against one of them asks
here, and when the thing is absent it SKIPS BY NAME with the recipe that
provides it, instead of failing on a path that only ever existed on the
machine the test was written on.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: nine CPU-tier tests opened a source tree, a queue
program or a receipt folder by an absolute home path, so on every other host
(public CI included) they failed with FileNotFoundError instead of saying what
they needed (release hygiene, 2026-10-14).

MPAS-A v8.4.2 source
    ``MPAS_REF`` (the older spellings ``MPAS_V842_SOURCE``, ``MPAS_V842_REF``,
    ``MPAS_ORACLE_SOURCE`` and ``MPAS_ORACLE_NATIVE_SOURCE`` are read first
    where a test used them).  Recipe: ``MPAS_SOURCE_RECIPE``.
Proof receipts a test writes
    the named environment variable, else a temporary folder.
The pinned RRFS fork and its published decks
    the test's own variable, else ``ref/rrfs/`` under ``MPAS_LANES`` on a
    maintainers' pool host, else ``vendor/`` in this checkout (the order
    tools/check_mpas_citations.py resolves the fork in).  Recipe: ``RRFS_SOURCE_RECIPE``.
