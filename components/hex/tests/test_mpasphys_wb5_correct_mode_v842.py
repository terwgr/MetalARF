"""Correct mode WB5 (cluster mpas-water-budget): WSM6's below-ground rain-out with the remap's profile.

Native v8.4.2 mp_wsm6.F90:1984 and :2254 book the part of the straddling sedimentation cell that falls below
the ground at the flat cell mean, while the remap moved the rest with a piecewise-linear profile, so column
plus surface water is not conserved. The native correct-mode build books it with the same profile. The
hex-cuda WSM6 slot compiles its scheme from text with those two statements corrected; exact mode compiles
the original text. CPU checks here; the whole-column words against the native build are in
tests/mpas_wb5_v842/test_mpasphys_wb5_columns_gpu_v842.py.
