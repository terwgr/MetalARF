"""The automatic observation scorer must start CPU-only, so a card lease is not held for it.

Breakage (U-H7): the scorer watcher (woof.hex.observation_scorecard watch) starts after the forecast's RECEIPT
inside the leased command's process tree. The pool runners keep a lease until every descendant exits unless
every process left was started with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES set and empty (release_for_cpu_only_tail); a watcher
started with the card visible held a 32,000 MiB RTX 5090 lease ~5 min after RECEIPT (mz24-a32-arwen-lts,
2026-10-27). This pins the watcher's half of that contract: an empty CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in its own environment,
in its own session, with no stdout/stderr pipe back to the door.
