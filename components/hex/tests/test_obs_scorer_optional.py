"""A build without the observation scorer installs, and says so by name.

THE BREAKAGE: setup.py demanded hex_obs_scorecard and built it through the
installed woof's tools/rustwx, which an installed woof wheel does not have,
so `pip install woof hex` from the sdist failed on every host the manylinux
wheel does not cover (golden 0.4.0 verifier, G3 sdist-build.log).  The build
now leaves the scorer out with a printed reason; these tests hold the runtime
half: the score path refuses by name and doctor reports a non-blocking gap.
