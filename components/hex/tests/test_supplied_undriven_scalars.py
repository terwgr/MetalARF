"""The receipt's supplied-but-undriven species list (rrfs-h-h4a finding).

``select_lbc_scalar_names`` returns the stream's ``lbc_``-prefixed names, and
the undriven list compared the bare species name against them, so every
driven mass (lbc_qv ... lbc_qg) was recorded as undriven beside the aerosol
pair.  The list must hold only the species the stream carries and the row
does not drive.
