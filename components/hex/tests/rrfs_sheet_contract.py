"""Audit forecast-bound sheets and recorded inspection under the owner's visual ruling.

Artifact validation cannot look at weather. The lane opens every PNG and records
its observations; the integrator opens the same files before landing. This audit
prevents unrelated forecasts, omitted panels, or unreviewed images from being
presented as that inspection. Weather decoding and rendering remain Rust.
