"""A convection-permitting nest is emitted with the HRRR-shape suite, not the gfs/era5-class Morrison default.

The defect: `woof domain --source hex-global` with no profile gave every
3 km nest Morrison, whose wet-snow reflectivity showed a 55-65 dBZ shield over the stratiform (Kansas trigger nest
+6 h: 42,822 km2 >= 50 dBZ against MRMS 1,107).
