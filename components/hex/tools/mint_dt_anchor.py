"""Mint and verify a model-timestep anchor for the frozen v8.4.1 lane.

``woof.hex.dt_admission`` refuses any ``config_dt`` holding no anchor.  This
is the runnable procedure that mints one, and the verifier that decides
whether a registered row is telling the truth.

An anchor has two halves and they cost very different things.

**The schedule receipt (host only, seconds).**  Everything a timestep can
get wrong before it ever reaches a card: the physics cadence step counts,
the Grell-Freitas ``cudt == dt`` law, the RK schedule's shape against the
proven 120 s schedule, the WSM6 minor-loop split, and clock closure over the
run length.  ``--dt`` mints it; ``--verify`` re-derives every registered
row's receipt and compares it to the JSON the row names, so a row cannot
point at a file that says something else.

**The integration anchor (one card, hours).**  Two forecasts of the same
case at this timestep whose history is byte-identical under masked digests,
finite at every step.  ``--integration-plan`` prints the exact commands and
the measured cost; this tool does not run them, because a forecast is the
forecast door's job and duplicating it here would create a second execution
path for the same thing.

**The mutation control.**  ``--mutation-control`` proves the verifier has
teeth in BOTH directions: it must pass the real 120 s row and it must fail
every fabricated variant of it -- a receipt file that does not exist, a
receipt whose dt does not match the row, a receipt whose cadence counts were
edited, and a row whose declared cadences contradict its own receipt.  A
verifier that only ever passes is not evidence of anything.

Nothing here registers anything.  Registering a second anchor moves the
frozen lane off its proven timestep and that is a ruling, not a tool run.
