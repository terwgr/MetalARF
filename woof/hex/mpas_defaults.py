"""MPAS-A v8.4.2 Registry defaults, the defaults a bare hex run gets.

Owner ruling 2026-10-10: a bare run uses MPAS's actual defaults.
A bare ``woof hex forecast`` integrates the dycore schedule, the physics
cadences and the timestep MPAS-Atmosphere v8.4.2 itself defaults to.  Every
value below cites the line of the upstream source it is read from
(MPAS-Model tag ``v8.4.2``, ``src/core_atmosphere/Registry.xml`` SHA-256
``c2eff7d95ec3867af69a945908955076d5f97dfe943f2d25ad756d98b94d86b3``; the
cited lines are kept in ``verification/mpas-v8.4.2-registry/``).  Every
value stays overridable from the CLI (``--dt``,
``--time-integration-order``, ``--acoustic-substeps``,
``--radiation-seconds``, ``--pbl-cadence``, ``--no-monotonic``) and from a
``--physics-namelist``.

Re-pinned from v8.4.1 on 2026-10-11 (:data:`UPSTREAM_PIN`).  One default
moved with the pin: ``config_number_of_sub_steps`` went from 2 to 4, because
two acoustic sub-steps can put noise in the jet streams of
convection-permitting runs and unphysical kinetic energy at the highest
wavenumbers (v8.4.2 release notes).  Two stays selectable
(``--acoustic-substeps 2``) and is what every earlier bare hex run took.

The configuration the native x4 reference was integrated at (RK3, six
acoustic sub-steps, 120 s, radiation every 600 s) is NOT a default any more.
It is :data:`X4_RECORDED_SCHEDULE`, which the hex self-reproducibility tests and the x4
proof pass explicitly; a run that matches it says so in its receipt.
