"""SHA-256 of large input files, computed once per file version.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, MEASURED (8-card RTX PRO 6000 host, 2026-10-10): a 15 km global
forecast re-read and re-hashed about 42 GB of unchanged bytes before its first
step -- the 3.6 GB grid and 5.0 GB static at the mesh-row bind and again at
the authority check, and the 24.6 GB init that the init door had hashed a
minute earlier -- about 55 s of the 191 s host start (prep.door 25.8 s, and
29.5 s of prep.host before the first cache load).  Every digest is still the
file's real SHA-256; this only stops computing the same one twice.

A digest is reused only for the same file VERSION: same device, inode, size,
modification time and status-change time (st_ctime_ns, which no user call can
set back).  Rewriting, truncating, replacing or touching a file changes at
least one of them and the next call hashes it again.  Small files are always
hashed directly.

``WOOF_HEX_DIGEST_CACHE`` names the cache directory (default
``~/.cache/gpuwm-hex/digests``); ``off`` disables reuse entirely.
