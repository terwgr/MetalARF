"""The money and card checks a ``[hex_nests]`` firing must pass, at fire time.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: the forecast loop armed its trigger without the
two checks the design names for a firing -- "the card has room for one more
nest" and "the remaining hold covers one more nest's worst case" -- so trigger
nests could overfill the card and, with the hold never consulted, run past what
the user authorised (shapes 2-3 checker, 2026-10-23).

THE NUMBERS ARE THE SITE'S.  The prices are computed once, by the site's
pricing (``apps/web/src/lib/nest-addon.ts`` ``triggerHold``), and reach the box
in the job; the worker puts them in the ``[hex_nests]`` table as ``hold``, and
the loop writes them to ``<forecast>/nest-hold.json`` when it arms.  This
module only does cents arithmetic on them:

* ``hold_cents``            what arming held from the user's balance;
* ``reserve_cents``         the reclaim reserve inside it (never given to a firing);
* ``per_firing_cents``      one firing's own hold: the most it can be charged;
* ``per_firing_quote_cents`` one firing's quote: the least it is charged;
* ``overrun_factor``        the charge's margin over measured cost (1.25);
* ``output_seconds``        the upload tail the site adds to every nest's cost
                            (nest-addon.ts ``outputSeconds``; 120 s when the
                            table predates the key).

A firing fires only when ``hold - reserve - committed >= per_firing_cents``,
where ``committed`` is each earlier firing's final charge once its nest has
ended (``nest-hold-spent.jsonl``, written by ``add-nest``) and its whole
``per_firing_cents`` while it runs.  The firing row carries ``budget_cents``;
``add-nest`` stops the nest when its measured cost reaches ``budget_cents /
overrun_factor`` less the upload tail that follows the stop (the site's
``nestStopCents``), so its charge (measured cost x overrun, capped at the
budget) is never below its cost and the run's total never passes its hold.
(Before 2026-10-24 the box left the tail out: a trigger nest stopped at its
hold cost up to 186 cents against a 172.8-cent stop, and the box and the site
stopped nests by different rules.)

The card check is a reservation in :mod:`woof.hex.card_ledger`, sized by the
nest's own estimate (``<forecast>/nest-fire-budget.json``, written by
``add-nest --watch`` from the engine's estimator for the table's nest), made
atomically so two quick firings cannot both pass.
