"""Number concentrations handed from a hex parent to a hex region: carried when published, else diagnosed.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (init-from-any-run proof, 2026-10-24).  A child handed hydrometeor MASS with number
concentration 0 sizes that mass at its scheme's PSD limits: Thompson's entry block makes 2.5 mm rain and
drizzle-sized droplets of it, reflectivity from it reads 60-70 dBZ rings or NaN, and in the ArWen 1 km child it
seeded spurious early cells.  On the hex-region route (``woof hex regional --parent-*``) the numbers were lost
twice: ``parent_state`` copied a frame variable only when the parent's init already held it (an init holds no
ni/nr/nc), and the start and boundary remaps moved the six water masses only.  A region running a number-carrying
row (aerosol-aware Thompson, the MYNN/RUC/GSL suite) then either refused the partial species row at the forecast
door or started its numbers from +0 against carried mass.

The rule, the same one the engine applies on its own parent -> child routes:

* a number the parent's frames publish is CARRIED (remapped like every scalar, into the start and every boundary
  frame);
* a number the region's row carries and the parent does not publish is DIAGNOSED from the mass with the region
  scheme's own relations, only where the mass is above zero and the number is not -- for the Thompson family the
  scheme's cold-start functions (WRF module_mp_thompson.F make_RainNumber :9163-9194, make_IceNumber :9044-9114,
  make_DropletNumber :9119-9158, ported bitwise in woof.core.thompson_entry), per volume at the moist density
  MPAS's physics interface forms (``rho_p = zz rho_zz (1 + qv)``), divided back to per kilogram;
* the two aerosol numbers (nwfa, nifa) have no mass to diagnose from; absent from the parent they start at the
  same +0 a cold start gives them today, and the droplet number is sized with no aerosol (make_DropletNumber's
  qnwfa <= 0 branch, by the surface type).

An exact physics mode (``--physics-mode exact``, or a strict process, GPUWM_WRF_EXACT=1) keeps today's numbers: it
diagnoses nothing.  Carrying a published number is not a correction and runs in every mode.

A number that is neither carried nor diagnosed is never PUBLISHED (:func:`complete_state_numbers`): written as a +0
plane it would be driven at the rings as number 0 under the driven mass, the very breakage above, and an exact or
no-diagnosis region under a numberless parent (the default WSM6 one) keeps the six-mass boundary it had before.
