"""Every gate ``rw_mpas_mesh`` applies at GENERATION, asked of the SPEC.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, MEASURED 2026-08-28.  ``rw_mpas_mesh --dry-run``
sizes a resolution spec, prints a receipt and exits 0.  It does not apply the
gates the build applies, and two of those gates refuse specs that sizing has
just called fine:

* the **transition-band gate** (``rw-mpas`` ``mesh/hierarchy.rs``,
  ``generate_graded``) refuses a spec whose steepest requested spacing
  gradient packs a refinement level's transition band into fewer than twice
  the 3-cell surgery locality radius.  It is pure arithmetic on the SAME
  number the dry-run receipt already prints as
  ``steepest_requested_gradient_percent_per_cell``, and it refuses in about
  90 ms -- *after* a user has authored, sized and accepted the spec.
* the **short dual edge floor** (``rw-mpas`` ``mesh/validate.rs``,
  ``Limits::min_dv_edge_m``) reads the finished tessellation, so it cannot
  fire until the whole ladder has been relaxed.  Measured here on a
  0.75/3/15/75 km design that cleared the transition-band gate: **1,251 s**
  to derive 217,621 cells and then refuse edge 562175 -- ``dvEdge`` 36.8 m
  against ``dcEdge`` 886 m -- with no grid written.  The report that opened
  this lane measured the same shape at 711 s, 220,468 cells and edge 655199
  (39.2 m over 937 m) on another box.

  **THAT FLOOR MOVED WITH THE STORAGE ON 2026-08-29, and this module moved
  with it.**  The floor is not a length any more, it is 400 COORDINATE QUANTA
  (``mesh/validate.rs::DV_EDGE_FLOOR_QUANTA``): the breakage it prevents is
  the orthogonality defect storage rounding puts into the point set,
  ``1.935 * q / dvEdge`` at the worst edge, measured on both published
  statics' own bytes.  At the published binary32 representation the quantum
  is 0.5 m and 400 quanta is 200.0 m to the bit, so nothing moved for a mesh
  with a native MPAS-A counterpart.  A mesh ``rw_mpas_mesh`` GENERATES has no
  native counterpart and its static stores coordinates at binary64, where the
  quantum is 9.313e-10 m and the same budget reads **3.725e-7 m**.  Every
  refusal quoted above was a binary32 refusal of a generated mesh, and none of
  them would happen today.  Leaving 200 m transcribed here would have told a
  user their 1 km spec was heading for a refusal it can no longer reach --
  which is this lane's own fault, pointed the other way.

This module is the answer to the first: the cheap gate is applied where the
sizing happens, so a spec generation will refuse is refused by sizing first.
It is also the answer to the second in the only form the second admits -- the
floor is NOT decidable from a spec, and saying so with the numbers that
decide it beats saying nothing.  See :func:`short_dual_edge_exposure`.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, AND WHY.  It does not move, soften or reinterpret
either floor.  The dual-edge floor has already survived a wrong-value episode
(the retired 7,500 m anchor refused the published ``x4.163842`` itself), and
the fix for "the user learns too late" is to change WHEN they learn, never
WHAT is allowed.  Every constant here is transcribed from the Rust that
enforces it, with the file named beside it, so a drift is a grep -- and the
2026-08-29 storage change is exactly the drift that discipline exists to
catch: the constant is now DERIVED here the same way it is derived there,
from the quanta and the representation, so the next storage change moves it
without an edit.

    evaluates before it seeds anything, spelled the same way: ``log(1 + g)``
    and not the more accurate ``log1p(g)``, because this function's job is to
    agree with the gate rather than to be right about the mathematics.

    WHERE THE TWO CAN STILL DISAGREE, STATED.  The gate reads its gradient as
    a fraction; a receipt prints that fraction times 100 and this reads it
    back divided by 100, which is a round trip that need not be exact.  The
    disagreement is at the last bit, so a spec within about 1e-15 of the

    AND WHY THAT SENTENCE USED TO BE WORTH NOTHING.  Agreement between the two

    number and neither measured it: this function is handed the gradient off

    WHY IT IS A SEARCH AND NOT A DIVISION.  This used to say the gradient is
    not monotone in the ramp width, and cited ``transition_cells``
    40/44/46/48 reading 21.45 / 23.93 / 21.51 / 24.82 % per cell on one
    0.75/6/75 km spec.  That non-monotonicity was SAMPLING NOISE, not a
    property of the field: the reading was a maximum over a Fibonacci lattice
    uniform over the whole sphere, and widening a ramp moved the field under a
    fixed point set rather than refining it.  RE-MEASURED 2026-08-29 on the
    corrected instrument, the same spec at ``transition_cells``
    40/42/44/46/48/50/60/80/108/160/240 reads 24.96 / 24.19 / 23.38 / 23.11 /
    21.94 / 21.67 / 19.56 / 16.15 / 13.52 / 10.20 / 7.60 -- monotone at every
    step, where the old instrument read 14.65 / 21.85 / 19.86 / 18.89 / 19.52
    / 17.35 / 10.64 / 14.17 / 9.55 / 7.48 / 7.31 and rose on five of them.

    IT IS STILL A SEARCH, and now for a reason that is about the FIELD.  One
    isolated ramp's peak gradient is exactly ``(h_bg - h_i) / (2 W)``, so
    widening it once would settle the remedy by division -- but a nested
    ladder is not one ramp.  Each rung's real neighbour is the next rung, and
    widening every ramp together changes which branch is steepest, so the
    composite falls SLOWER than ``1 / W``: over the sweep above, the value
    ``1/W`` would predict climbs from 24.96 to 45.59 % per cell.  A division
    would under-widen and quote a remedy that does not clear.  So ``g / g_max``
    stays the opening bid, each attempt widens it by half again, and the first
    that MEASURES clear is the one quoted.  ``None`` means no attempt cleared,
    which is reported as such rather than guessed past.

    WHAT THE OLD INSTRUMENT DID TO THIS FUNCTION, so the retirement is not
    mistaken for tidying: measured on the same spec, the search used to quote
    a widening whose own true gradient was still over the ceiling, and the
    build then ADMITTED it because the build under-read it identically. The
    remedy the door printed closed the loop on itself.

    it does not fix where the pentagon-heptagon dislocations land or how far
    their two Voronoi vertices anneal apart, and those are what the floor
    measures.  Refusing a spec here on a prediction would refuse meshes the
    generator would have emitted -- the same failure this lane exists to
    close, pointed the other way.

    What IS decidable, and is computed here:

    * the floor is a LENGTH and the mesh's own guard is a RATIO, and the two
      meet at ``dcEdge``.  At a finest spacing ``s`` the 200 m floor demands
      ``dvEdge/dcEdge >= 200 / s`` of the finest edges.  Below
      ``s = 200 / 0.02 = 10 km`` that demand is STRICTER than the 0.02 ratio
      floor the generator and this port both admit on, by ``10 km / s``.
    * a PREDICTION BAND, from :data:`MEASURED_GRADED_MESHES`.  Surgery flags
      a quad for repair only below ``dv/dc`` 0.04 and stops there, so every
      graded mesh in that table lands on the flag floor (0.0401 to 0.0427)
      and its shortest dual edge is that ratio times the ``dcEdge`` carrying
      it, which is 1.2x to 2.7x the request.  The band of ``min dvEdge /
      finest requested`` is what gets quoted.  It never refuses: a wrong
      prediction in the strict direction would talk a user out of a spec
      that builds, which a first draft of this function did to every shipped
      4 km swath.
    * a one-sided immunity: if even the fine tail of the delivery
      distribution keeps ``0.02 * dcEdge >= 200 m``, then no edge can fail
      the length floor without already failing the ratio floor, so the
      length floor cannot be the binding refusal.
    * the earliest ladder level at which an offending edge can exist at all.
      Every level finishes surgery at or above 0.03, so a level whose
      spacing ``h`` satisfies ``0.03 * h >= 200 m`` is provably clear.  The
      first level below ``200 / 0.03 = 6.67 km`` is the first that can carry
      a refusal, and no amount of building before it can produce an answer.
