"""Engineering forecast driver for the MPAS-A v8.4.1 CUDA port.

DERIVED, NOT A PROOF.  This tool is a parameterized fork of the sealed proof
harness ``src/hexcore/drivers/run_cuda_v841_full_physics_x4.py``.  It exists because that
harness is a one-case proof: it pins the init file's SHA-256, its start time,
its step count and its per-case F000 surface-diagnostic bytes, and it spends
half its run comparing against a sealed native CPU authority that exists for
exactly one case.  None of that can execute a forecast from a different
initial condition.

THE FORK IS IMPORT-BASED ON PURPOSE.  Every executing model path -- mesh load,
overlays, constructor arrays, the staged two-owner composite step, the physics
configuration, the snapshot capture -- is CALLED FROM the proof module, not
copied.  Two functions are re-implemented here (``_prepare_host_execution`` and
``build_arwen_constructor_values``) because they carry case literals in their
bodies rather than in module constants; both re-implementations are faithful
transcriptions with the case assertions replaced by measurement, and the
values they hand to the model are constructed identically.  The proof module's
file bytes are never modified and its own entry point is unaffected.

WHAT IS KEPT (unchanged, still enforced, refusal on violation)
  * the engine identity: HEAD/tree/clean (a git tree) or version and RECORD
    digest (an install) and the measured seam digests, recorded before and
    after the run by ``verify_arwen_checkout_git``;
  * ``EXECUTION_SOURCE_PINS``: exact SHA-256 of every executing port module,
    verified before CUDA is imported and again after the forecast;
  * the mesh authority pins: grid and static file byte counts and SHA-256;
  * the rotation-aware precision-preserving mesh/static pair load, and both
    in-memory init overlays (reconstruction coefficients, edge normals) with
    every structural check they carry (topology equality with the prepared
    mesh, exact +0 padding, finiteness, placeholder provenance);
  * the full physics configuration exactly as proven:
    ``V841MpasColumnPhysicsSmagorinskyGwdoConfig`` by default (native's
    Registry deformation-based 2-D Smagorinsky horizontal mixing; a NEW
    sub-series, not bit-comparable to mixing-off arms), or the pre-mixing
    ``V841MpasColumnPhysicsGwdoConfig`` control under ``--horiz-mixing off``;
    both carry WSM6 + GF + YSU + external YSU-GWDO +
    revised-MO + NoahMP (+ glacier dispatch) + cloud fraction + legacy RRTMG,
    dt = 120 s, radiation 600 s, surface/PBL/cumulus 120 s, six-species scalar
    order, ``wsm6_hail_opt = 0``, ``xice_threshold = 0.02``, dx = 25000 m;
  * the staged two-owner transaction with its rollback contract
    (``execute_composite_step``), including the no-fail commit law;
  * the surface classification receipt and the NoahMP census/glacier-path
    check at every capture (the census is now measured from this init instead
    of pinned to the proof case, but a backend census that disagrees with the
    host classification still refuses);
  * the physical snapshot gate (finite everywhere, rho/theta/pressure > 0,
    soil moisture in [0,1], non-negative precipitation, hydrometeors >= 0);
  * the exact snapshot capture and its native-grid history writer.

WHAT IS REMOVED, AND WHY (every removal deliberate; guarantees dropped)
  1. THE INIT SHA-256 PIN.  ``AUTHORITY_PINS['init']`` fixes one file.  A
     forecast from another initial condition cannot satisfy it.  REPLACED BY:
     the actual init path, byte count and SHA-256 are measured and recorded in
     the receipt, and the receipt names the init's stated source.
     GUARANTEE DROPPED: this tool cannot tell you the init is the blessed one.
     It tells you exactly which bytes it ran.
  2. THE CASE-PINNED F000 SURFACE-DIAGNOSTIC PINS.  ``t2m``/``u10``/``v10``
     array SHA-256 for the proof case.  REPLACED BY: the same three fields are
     read from the supplied init, still required FP32 [Time,nCells], finite,
     and still overlaid only onto verified exact +0 placeholders; their
     digests are recorded.  GUARANTEE DROPPED: byte identity of the F000
     diagnostic overlay to the proof case.
  3. THE NATIVE-COMPARISON STAGE.  ``compare_snapshot_to_native`` and the six
     ``native_*`` authority files (F000/F030/F001 history, validation receipt,
     launch receipt, run closure), plus their RMSE gates.  Those files are the
     CPU authority for ONE case at ONE valid time; there is no such authority
     for any other case, and comparing a new forecast against them would be
     meaningless.  GUARANTEE DROPPED: no quantitative agreement with a native
     MPAS CPU run is established for these forecasts.  Nothing here is
     verified against native MPAS.
  4. THE CHECKPOINT/RESTART PROOF STAGE.  The F030 host checkpoint, the fresh
     restart worker process, F030 rehydration identity, first-resumed-step-16
     identity and the F001 bitwise restart comparison.  A forecast runs
     uninterrupted; the restart property is a property of the port and was
     proven by the release proof.  GUARANTEE DROPPED: these runs do not
     re-establish restart bitwise identity (and produce no checkpoint).
  5. THE CASE-PINNED INITIAL-CONTENT FINGERPRINTS, each replaced by a measured
     value recorded in the receipt:
       - ``NEGATIVE_QV_PIN`` (215 negative qv values at F000 in the proof
         case).  The count is now measured from this init; the physical gate
         still requires exactly that many at F000 and exactly zero after every
         subsequent step, so a clamp regression still refuses.
       - ``INIT_RECONSTRUCTION_COEFFICIENTS_PIN.init_carrier_raw_sha256`` and
         ``INIT_EDGE_NORMAL_VECTORS_PIN.init_carrier_raw_sha256`` plus the
         edge-normal activity counts and norm envelope.  These are mesh
         geometry regenerated by ``init_atmosphere`` per init, so they are
         recorded, not pinned.  ADDED IN THEIR PLACE: an explicit physical
         bound, every edge-normal row norm within 1e-4 of unity, which the
         pinned envelope previously implied.
       - ``EXPECTED_SURFACE_CLASSIFICATION`` / ``EXPECTED_NOAHMP_CENSUS`` /
         the xland, glacier-index, sea-ice-index and threshold-delta digests.
         Land/water/sea-ice/glacier counts are date-dependent (sea ice moves).
         Measured, recorded, and the backend's own census must still equal the
         host classification at every capture.
       - ``LANDMASK_CONSTRUCTOR_CAST_PIN``.  The exactness of the int32 ->
         FP32 cast is still checked (round-trip equality and the {0,1} value
         set); only the case digests are recorded instead of pinned.
       - ``EXPECTED_ARWEN_P_TOP_PA_F32`` / ``EXPECTED_TOP_PRESSURE_RANGE_PA``.
         p_top is derived from the init's own pressure field.  This driver
         re-derives the expectation with the identical FP32 reduction and
         seeds it; the proof function then recomputes it independently and
         still asserts equality, so a transcription error refuses instead of
         passing.  The derived scalar and the per-column min/median/max are
         recorded.
       - ``START_TIME_TEXT``.  The init's ``config_start_time`` is now the
         authority; ``--start-time`` is an assertion against it, not a source.
  6. THE FIXED 30-STEP / F000-F030-F001 SCHEDULE.  Replaced by ``--hours`` and
     ``--history-every-minutes``.  dt stays 120 s and every physics cadence
     stays as proven; only the number of steps and the capture set move.
     GUARANTEE DROPPED: the proof's three-snapshot schedule and its labels.

WHAT IS ADDED
  7. THE F000 START-FRAME COMPLETION (:func:`complete_f000_surface_diagnostics`).
     The proof overlays ``t2``/``u10``/``v10`` from the init onto the seam's
     pre-first-call placeholders and publishes ``q2`` and ``psfc`` as the
     placeholders themselves (+0 and 100000 Pa), because the native F000 it
     is compared against carries the same.  A forecast's start frame is a
     product, so this driver completes it the way the regional engine writes
     its own hour 0: ``q2`` from the start file when the start file carries
     one, otherwise from the lowest model level, and ``psfc`` from the model's
     own surface pressure.  Every later frame is untouched, and so is the
     model state.

FORK-EQUIVALENCE GATE.  Because this driver reaches the model through the
proof module's own functions, a fork defect would show up as a changed
trajectory.  ``tools/gate_v841_forecast_fork_equivalence.py`` runs THIS driver
on the AUTHORITY init for 30 steps and compares its boundary fingerprints and
snapshot array digests bitwise against the release-proof uninterrupted arm.
BITWISE-IDENTICAL is required before any showcase forecast is run.

The claim, and the non-claims, are stated in the receipt.  These are
engineering forecasts on a 92-to-25 km variable-resolution global mesh.  They
establish no forecast skill.

    THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, MEASURED (2026-08-26, the proving RTX 5090):
    this function did not exist and the configuration was constructed from
    its dataclass defaults, so ``config_dt`` was 120.0 no matter what mesh
    was bound.  ``bind_mesh`` rebinds ``DT_SECONDS`` in this module and in
    the proof module, and the sealed Arwen constructor read that rebound
    value -- but the DYCORE takes its outer step from ``config.config_dt``,
    which nothing rebound.  A mesh row declaring 100 s therefore bound
    clean, allocated 18,820 MiB, spent 285 s and died inside composite
    step 0 with ``post-RK candidate time must equal the exact step
    endpoint: 120.0 != 100.0``.

    There is now ONE timestep in this path: the bound mesh's.  It reaches
    the config here, and ``build_forecast_constructor_values`` derives the
    seam's clocks from the config rather than from the module constant, so
    the two cannot disagree by construction.  An unanchored timestep is
    refused by ``config.validate()`` below, on the host, before a mesh file
    is opened -- which is where a 285-second refusal belongs.

    The two cadences welded to the timestep travel with it.  ``cudt`` has
    no choice: WRF pins ``cudt = 0`` for Grell-Freitas, so the sealed
    constructor requires ``cumulus_seconds == dt``.  ``bldt`` follows dt by
    DEFAULT because that is the proven configuration's own semantics -- the
    native x4 reference ran ``bldt = dt``, i.e. surface/PBL every step --
    and ``surface_pbl_seconds`` is how an A/B arm holds it there while dt
    moves.  ``None`` is the weld and changes no run; an explicit value is an
    instrument and records itself as one.  See :mod:`woof.hex.pbl_cadence`
    for the measurement that needed it and the breakage its registry key
