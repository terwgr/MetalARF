"""F000: the start state's surface diagnostics, from the forecast's own first physics call.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS.  A start frame is written before any physics has run, so
every surface-layer and boundary-layer diagnostic in it is the init's value or the
seam's pre-first-call placeholder.  A start file that carries no 10 m wind (the HRRR
specific-humidity road writes ``u10``/``v10`` as the -1e30 missing value in every
cell) therefore published f000 with no 10 m wind: every f000 point sounding showed
"0-6 km shear NaN kt" and n/a helicity, the meteogram had no f000 barb, and the f000
10 m wind maps were empty (graded-plateau 1 km region, 2026-10-24, also on stock
0.4.4).  The fluxes and the boundary-layer depth (``hfx``, ``qfx``, ``lh``, ``pblh``)
were exact zero at f000 on every start.

THE FIX.  The forecast's first physics call runs at the start of step 1 on the start
state (MPAS-A's physics_driver order: surface layer, land surface and PBL before the
dynamics).  Its surface-layer output IS the scheme's diagnosis of the start state, by
the same scheme the forecast runs.  The drivers hold the f000 frame until step 1 has
run, read those fields once, and complete the frame:

* analysis fields (10 m wind, 2 m temperature): the start file's own value where it
  carries one; the first call's diagnosis in every cell where it does not
  (non-finite, or a missing-value magnitude);
* 2 m humidity: the first call's when the start file carried none;
* fluxes and PBL depth: the first call's, replacing the pre-first-call exact zero.

The model state is untouched; only the f000 history frame changes.  A run with no
step (``--hours 0``), a refused first step or a resumed start keeps the old frame and
says so in its receipt.  The MPAS suite route applies this in correct mode only:
exact mode writes native MPAS-A's f000 bit for bit.
