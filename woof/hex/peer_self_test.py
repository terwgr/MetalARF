"""Startup peer-copy self-test: does a card pair's direct peer route move the right bytes?

Standalone on purpose: it imports nothing from woof.hex, takes the array module (CuPy) as an
argument, and returns plain records, so the engine's tilestream transport and Global's NCCL
setup can call or vendor the same check verbatim and read the same verdict.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, MEASURED (2026-10-05, a rented 8x RTX PRO 6000
container): deviceCanAccessPeer reported 1 both ways, peer access enabled, and
cudaMemcpyPeerAsync completed with success at 17-42 GB/s, yet every copied word but the
first was wrong, at 4 KiB to 512 MiB, in both directions; a kernel reading peer memory
directly was equally wrong.  Same-host hex halos over that route made every N-rank forecast
non-finite at step 1, and NCCL's P2P transport there never completed its first broadcast.
On a healthy host of the same model the same test moves every word exactly.
Success codes do not prove the bytes, so the bytes are checked.

Verdict per ordered pair: ``passed`` (every word exact), ``wrong_data`` (copy finished,
words differ) or ``timeout`` (copy did not finish inside the bound; the pair may hang).
A caller stages, or disables P2P for, any pair that did not pass, and records why.
