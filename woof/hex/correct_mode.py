"""``physics.mode``: the matched arithmetic or the corrected arithmetic.

The shared key of the 2026-10-13 correct-mode work (MODE-KEY):

``"exact"``
    The matched arithmetic (native MPAS-A v8.4.2, the engine's WRF/MMM
    transcriptions), defects included.  With it the door, the driver, the
    sealed constructor and the engine seam are built exactly as before the
    key existed, so the byte-identity claims hold.  Every identity proof and
    parity configuration names ``exact`` explicitly.
``"correct"``
    Every correction the run's code carries, minus ``physics.correct_skip``.
    This is the default of every entry point hex ships (owner ruling
    2026-10-13: correct mode is the standard; exact stays one flag away).

ONE TABLE OF FINDINGS.  :data:`FINDINGS` names every switchable finding id
the hex routes know and where its correction lives.  The WOOF column route's
water-budget corrections live in the woof engine (``woof.correct_mode``);
the IAU corrections in :mod:`woof.hex.iau_v842`; the boundary corrections in
the engine's ``rw_mpas_lbc``.  :func:`known_findings` adds the MPAS-suite
driver's own table (``woof.hex.mpasphys.driver_v842.CORRECTIONS_V842``) and
the imported engine's registry when they exist, so a skip list is checked
against one set of names whichever route runs.

A CORRECTION THE RUN CANNOT APPLY IS A LOUD NAMED GAP, NEVER A REFUSAL
(release ruling 2026-10-14 for 0.4.0).  When a correct-mode run reaches code
that does not carry a correction (an engine without ``woof.correct_mode``,
an engine seam that takes no mode keywords, an ``rw_mpas_lbc`` without
``--physics-mode``), the run goes ahead with the matched arithmetic for that
finding, prints one ``CORRECT MODE: named gap`` line per finding on stderr,
raises a :class:`CorrectModeGapWarning`, and lists the finding under
``correct_mode.gaps`` in its receipt ({finding, slot, reason, owner}, the
shape the MPAS-suite route writes).  The receipt never says a finding was
applied when it was not: ``applied`` lists only what the code carried.

A misspelt mode or an unknown finding id is still refused at the door, before
any input is read: a typo must never silently mean either mode.
