"""Write forecast history frames in a background process.

THE COST THIS REMOVES, MEASURED (2026-10-05, start-up lane receipts in
``evidence/hex-startup-20261005/``): the step-0 history frame is one netCDF4
file with zlib level-1 variables, written by ``write_snapshot_netcdf`` at
about 40 MB/s on one core.  It sat between the step-0 capture and the first
forecast step: 1.15 GB and most of the 37.6 s step-0 output phase of the
135 s warm start on the published 30 km mesh, 7.2 s of 12.9 s on conus12km.
Every later frame stalled the step loop the same way.

WHAT THIS DOES.  The forecast still captures each frame on its own thread,
exactly as before (capture allocates device memory, and that order is kept).
The captured host arrays are then handed to ONE writer process, which calls
the SAME function from the SAME module file with the SAME module constants
the forecast process holds at hand-off (the mesh binding rebinds
``N_CELLS`` and friends at run time; the writer receives their values), so
each history file is byte-for-byte the file the forecast would have written
itself.  Frames are written in the order they were handed over.  The
forecast waits for every frame before it writes its receipts, so a finished
run has every file and every file digest it had before.
The pipe carries only control messages. Protocol-5 array buffers are copied
in parallel to one temporary spool per frame and privately mapped by the
child. The spool survives until the reply, then is removed. This uses the
same bounded transport as the same-host writer; WOOF_HEX_HISTORY_SPOOL
selects its directory (default the frame's output directory).

WHY A PROCESS AND NOT A THREAD.  The forecast runs on the free-threaded
interpreter, and the netCDF4/HDF5 extension is not safe for concurrent use
(``drivers/samehost_serial_io_v841.py`` keeps it on one thread for that
reason).  A regional forecast reads its boundary files while it steps; a
writer thread would call into the same library at the same time.  A
separate process has its own copy of the library.

THE GUARDS, AND THE BREAKAGE EACH PREVENTS.
* The child imports the writer's module by name and refuses unless it
  resolved to the same file the forecast imported.  Prevents: a different
  installed copy of hexcore writing the frames.
* At most ``max_pending`` frames are in flight; a capture waits for the
  oldest before handing over another.  Prevents: a run that writes history
  every step holding every captured frame in host memory at once.
* A frame the writer did not complete (the process died, it could not
  start, the hand-off failed) is written again on the forecast thread, the
  way it always was, after any partial file is removed; the receipt says
  so.  An error the writer function itself raised (a refusal such as an
  existing file) is raised in the forecast exactly as a direct call would.
* At interpreter exit, frames already handed over are finished.  Prevents:
  a forecast that raises mid-run losing frames a direct write would have
  left on disk.

THE COMPRESSION ON EVERY CORE (B4, 2026-10-16).  Inside the writer process
each frame of ``write_snapshot_netcdf`` runs with :mod:`woof.hex.history_deflate`
open: the Rust library ``rust/history-deflate`` compresses every chunk on
worker threads ahead of HDF5 and hands HDF5 the stream its own single-thread
deflate would have made, so the file is the same bytes and the 115 s a 15 km
frame spent in zlib on one core is spread over the CPUs.  Each frame's
receipt row carries the counts under ``deflate`` (``hits`` precomputed,
``misses`` left to HDF5).  ``WOOF_HEX_HISTORY_DEFLATE=off`` writes the frames
the single-thread way.

``WOOF_HEX_HISTORY_BACKGROUND=off`` writes every frame on the forecast
thread, as before.
