"""The ONE device-memory admission surface for the v8.4.1 CUDA lane.

Every "will this mesh fit this card?" decision in the project answers from
this module: the forecast door's ``--preflight`` verdict, the door's real-run
admission, and the driver's own floor (``MIN_FREE_DEVICE_BYTES``, rebound per
mesh by ``src/hexcore/drivers/mpas_mesh_binding.py``) all call :func:`required_free_bytes`
with the same model, so they agree to the byte -- and therefore to the cell.
Before this module existed the door predicted from a measured affine row
while the driver held a separate linear floor scaled from an asserted 24 GiB
constant; a card between the two answers passed one gate and died on the
other, which is the concrete breakage a single surface prevents.

THE MODEL HAS A SHAPE NOW, AND THE SHAPE IS NOT A LINE (2026-08-27).
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Every row this module has ever shipped was ``fixed + slope * cells``.  That
form was refuted by measurement, not by argument:

* Across five full-physics forecast-door runs on placed variable-resolution
  meshes the affine row's error spanned **+3.89 % to -6.76 %**, and one mesh
  with 15,343 MORE cells peaked 318 MiB LOWER.  A function linear in cell
  count cannot do that.
* One of those runs (``v6.75.112676``) peaked **96 MiB past its own
  ``required_free``** -- the flat 512 MiB headroom did not cover it.
* On the limited-area path the affine row over-predicted every one of five
  concentric culls by 1.2-1.9 GiB: 4,440 -> 15,755 cells (3.5x) moved the
  measured peak only 5,552 -> 7,728 MiB (1.39x).

The per-allocation ledger (``tools/device_memory_ledger/``) says why,
and the arithmetic below reproduces its measured block sizes exactly.  The
process footprint is

    peak(cells, card) = core(card, configuration)
                      + SUM over tiled workspaces of ws(min(cells, tile(card)))
                      + bytes_per_cell * cells

THE TILED WORKSPACES ARE THE MISSING TERM.  Three physics kernels keep their
column arrays in a GLOBAL device workspace sized to the threads the CARD can
hold in flight, capped by the mesh -- ``min(cells, tile)``.  Below the tile
the term is proportional to cells; above it the term is CONSTANT.  That knee
is the shape a line cannot have, and the tiles are large enough to matter:

    Grell-Freitas  gf.py::gf_tile_columns    tile = SMs x 4 x 64
    YSU            ysu.py::ysu_tile_columns  tile = SMs x 16 x 32
    RRTMG SW/LW    rrtmg_lw.py::batch_column_chunk
                                             chunk = quantised(resident
                                             threads / g-points), ceiling

On the 170 SM part the knees are 43,520 cells (GF) and 87,040 cells (YSU).
Both published fit meshes straddle them: ``x1.40962`` sits BELOW both and
``x4.163842`` ABOVE both, so the affine fit charged the tile growth between
them as if it were per-cell.  That is where 2,167 B of the retired row's
98,748 B/cell slope came from, and it is why the retired row over-predicts
every small mesh and every limited-area cull.

MEASURED PROOF THE TILE ARITHMETIC IS THE RIGHT ARITHMETIC.  The per-allocation ledger
records each site's largest single allocation at both meshes.  Every site in
the model scales exactly 4.00x with the 4x cell count EXCEPT three, and the
formulas above reproduce all three to the byte:

    site                          x1 MiB     x4 MiB   ratio   this module
    woof/core/gf.py (workspace)  1,262.0    1,338.8  1.06    641/680 blocks
    woof/core/ysu.py (workspace)   157.6      334.7  2.12    1,281/2,720
    woof/core/rrtmg_sw.py (wk_d) 1,745.6    1,745.6  1.00    2,048 columns

THE PEAK CHANGES SCHEME WITH MESH SIZE, which is the same finding from the
other side.  At 40,962 cells the largest thing live at the global peak is the
RRTMG shortwave ``spcvmc`` workspace -- one mesh-independent 1,830,420,480 B
block.  At 151,649 and 163,842 cells the peak instant is in the dycore and
that block is not live at it at all.  A single line through one radiation-set
point and one dycore-set point describes neither regime.

WHAT THE MARGIN ABSORBS, BY NAME (the gate law, 2026-08-16).
---------------------------------------------------------------

The retired 512 MiB headroom named nothing and failed by 96 MiB.  This model
carries a margin with two named, measured components and no padding:

1. **Arena placement of the largest mesh-independent block.**  There is no
   arena in this project: allocation goes to CuPy's default ``MemoryPool``,
   whose high-water is the set of blocks it has had to ``cudaMalloc``, not
   the peak live set.  Whether the 1,745.6 MiB shortwave workspace is
   servable from the pool's free list at the instant radiation runs depends
   on the arena layout, and the layout depends on the exact byte sizes of
   every per-cell array allocated before it.  This is MEASURED, twice, on an
   idle card: freeing 38.4 MiB EARLIER in the run moved ``x1.40962``'s pool
   high-water from 5,404.5 to 7,111.7 MiB -- **a 1,707.2 MiB rise from a
   38 MiB saving**, because that block stopped being servable from the free
   list (``STATE.md``, the construction-diagnostic hold).  The margin is that
   block, priced at the card's own chunk width: 1,745.6 MiB on a 170 SM
   part, 872.8 MiB on a 68 or 70 SM part.  The concrete breakage: a card
   admitted without it dies inside the CuPy allocation at the first
   radiation call, minutes into a run.
2. **Instrument convention.**  The fitted rows are per-process
   ``nvidia-smi``; the door faces whole-device free memory.  Measured side by
   side, the two conventions differ by 11.2 MiB (x4 arm) and 0.75 MiB
   (graded arm).  The margin carries the larger.

Nothing else is in the margin.  If a term is not measured it is not here.

PER-CARD ROWS, AND WHY ONE SHARED ROW WAS A DEFECT.
-----------------------------------------

The retired module carried an unused per-card tier table and **nothing ever read
it**: ``forecast_door._resolve_model`` returned the 170 SM row unless the
user typed ``--device-fixed-mib`` and ``--device-bytes-per-cell`` by hand.
So the 10 GiB desktop was priced with a 32 GiB card's fixed term and refused
``x1.40962`` and ``v15.150.38857`` -- two meshes it had been MEASURED running
with 2,244 MiB to spare.  That is the borrowed-row defect.  The door now reads the card's
multiprocessor count at decision time and selects or derives its row, so a
card that was never measured still gets its own arithmetic.

A DERIVED row is not a measured one and says so.  It scales the reference
card's core by the two mechanisms that are known and measured to scale with
the card -- the CUDA local-memory backing store (per-context, sized to the
widest launched frame times resident threads) and the radiation chunk width
-- and it lands CONSERVATIVE on both cards that have their own measurement:
+182.7 MiB on the 70 SM part and +490.8 MiB on the 68 SM part, both
over-predictions.  Direction matters more than magnitude for a gate.

CONFIGURATIONS ARE DATA, NOT CODE PATHS (the arbitrary acceptance test).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The global and limited-area paths build different device stacks -- the
regional one carries a padded atmosphere, two levels of lateral-boundary
state and 22 more kernels -- so they carry different cores.  They are two
rows of one table, not two functions.  Adding a card or a configuration is a
row; it is never a new branch.

STATED LIMITS, ON PAGE ONE OF THE MODULE.
-----------------------------------------

* The limited-area core is an ENVELOPE, not a fit: the per-allocation
  instrument has never been run on a regional mesh, so the core is the
  largest residue over five whole-device forecast-door samples.  One per-allocation ledger
  arm on a cull replaces it.
* The 16 GiB and 10 GiB cores were measured at hex ``5252421``, not at the
  merged tip, and carry :data:`PIN_RESTATEMENT_BYTES` for it.
* Every measurement in this module is 55 vertical levels, float32, WSM6 + GF
  + YSU + YSU-GWDO + revised-MO + NoahMP + cloud fraction + legacy RRTMG.
  The tiled-workspace terms are functions of ``nz``; nothing else here is.
* The four-swath spread that opened this lane is EXPLAINED IN MECHANISM but
  NOT SEPARATED IN MEASUREMENT: the four runs share card, pin, timestep,
  schedule and radiation cadence, so arena placement is the only candidate
  left standing, and no A/B on those four meshes has been run to prove it.

This module is stdlib-only at import, deliberately: the forecast door
imports it before any refusal, on boxes with no CUDA lane at all.
