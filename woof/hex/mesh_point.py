"""``woof hex mesh-plan --point``: a fine core at an arbitrary point.

WHAT THIS DOOR DOES.  Every registered sub-kilometre row this program
holds sits at 35.0 N 97.0 W, because a person typed its spec and its row.
This door takes a POINT, a fine spacing and a core radius, and does what
that person did, in order and with receipts:

1. writes the resolution spec -- the registered ``v0.9.120.110533`` recipe
   generalised: nested caps on one global background, each rung halving the
   spacing, each ramp a fixed multiple of its own spacing, each cap sitting
   a fixed number of ramps outside the next finer one -- centred on the
   point;
2. prices it through the generator's own ``--dry-run`` with the gates its
   build applies (:mod:`woof.hex.swath.sizing`), predicts what the limited-
   area CULL will cost, and prices THAT against the named card on the one
   admission surface (:mod:`woof.hex.device_admission`, the limited-area
   row), with the margin that surface names;
3. with ``--generate``: builds the pair (``rw_mpas_mesh``, then
   ``rw_mpas_static``), measures the pair's own admissions (dual edge, cell
   coordination, Courant at the declared timestep), registers it as a
   RUNTIME ROW (:mod:`woof.hex.mesh_rows`, a file beside the mesh, never a
   checkout edit), cuts the limited-area cull at the shipped pad and
   registers that too; and, with ``--vertical-spec``, mints the parent's
   native-free vertical artifact and culls it so the child can be
   initialised from a regional meteorological source.

WHY THE LADDER IS DATA.  The spec is a pure function of six numbers
(:func:`ladder_spec`); nothing here branches on a place.  Moving the core
is moving the centre of every cap.  The transition and ring factors are
the registered row's own (18 and 3) and are arguments, not constants a
reader has to trust.

WHAT IS PRICED, AND WHAT IS NOT.  The generator prices the whole GRADED
GLOBAL mesh; only the cull reaches a card.  The plan therefore quotes both
and admits on the second, exactly as the swath layer does
(:mod:`woof.hex.swath.sizing` states why).  The cull prediction is an area
integral at the generator's own attained spacing -- a bound, labelled
``basis: area_integral`` -- and the cull receipt replaces it with the count.

THE INITIAL CONDITION ROAD THIS DOOR PREPARES.  ``woof hex init`` refuses
a limited-area grid in its native-free mode: the closed-sphere vertical
authority does not invent exterior state (``woof.hex.vertical``).  A global
init needs global meteorology, and a regional source (HRRR) covers only
its own domain.  The road that satisfies both is: mint the vertical on the
GLOBAL parent (grid + static + spec, no meteorology), cull the artifact
with the same region as the grid and static, and hand the culled artifact
to ``woof hex init --capsule/--reference`` with the regional intermediate.
The cull moves no cell centre, so the child's vertical IS the parent's,
cell for cell.
