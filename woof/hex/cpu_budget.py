"""The CPUs this process may really use: affinity AND the container's CPU quota.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, MEASURED (rented box, 2026-10-26, uniform 15 km
global init, x1.2621442, 55 levels): the box listed 256 CPUs while its
container's cgroup quota granted 61.44.  The init's Rust vertical build ran
257 Rayon threads, the cgroup was throttled in 56,647 of 123,855 periods,
and the first vertical call never returned (Round 2 stopped it unfinished
after 3,511 s).  The same binary on the same input with 32 workers finished
the whole init in 242.9 s.  ``os.cpu_count()`` and ``sched_getaffinity`` both
said 256; only the quota files said 61.

So the quota is a hard limit, like affinity: at import (``woof/hex/__init__``)
the thread-count variables every Rust and OpenMP child of hex reads
(``RAYON_NUM_THREADS``, ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``) are set to this budget when
unset and lowered to it when an inherited value asks for more.  Nothing is
changed on a host whose quota does not bind below its affinity, so home
nodes and whole-machine boxes keep their thread counts exactly.  Thread count
changes scheduling only: Rayon collects and the vertical arrays are the same
bytes at any worker count (32 vs 256 workers, 10 arrays, identical SHA-256).

The quota is read on cgroup v2 (``cpu.max``) and v1 (``cpu.cfs_quota_us`` /
``cpu.cfs_period_us``) through every ancestor of this process's group that is
visible, and the smallest one wins, the same reading woof's preparation
workers use.  ``GPUWM_HEX_CPU_QUOTA=off`` leaves the variables alone.
