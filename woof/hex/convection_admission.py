"""Convection admission: OFF below 3 km, New Tiedtke at 20 km and coarser.

The default has three bands since 2026-10-05: no cumulus scheme below 3 km
(the 2026-08-26 ruling below), Grell-Freitas from 3 km up to 20 km, and New
Tiedtke at 20 km and coarser (``NTIEDTKE_AT_OR_ABOVE_M``, the ruling of
2026-10-05, with its measurement beside the constant).

It was ruled on 2026-08-26 that convection is switched off below 3 km,
answering directly whether a fine swath runs the cumulus scheme at all.
This module is that ruling made executable, and it is deliberately the only
place the threshold exists.

THE BREAKAGE THIS GATE PREVENTS, MEASURED (2026-08-26,
``evidence/dt-anchors-20260826/RECEIPT.md``).  WRF pins ``cudt = 0`` for
``cu_physics = 3``, so Grell-Freitas recomputes on every model step and no
configuration relaxes it -- the cumulus cadence IS the timestep.  A finer
mesh declares a smaller timestep, so it calls the closure proportionally
more often: 30 times an hour at the proven 120 s, 180 at 20 s (a 3 km
swath), 720 at 5 s (a 750 m swath).  At 5 s on ``x1.40962`` the measured
|w| mean over four half-hour windows ran 12.0 / 49.6 / 73.5 / 87.5 m/s
against a same-card 120 s control's 1.15 / 1.17 / 1.20 / 1.48, still
climbing at 2 h, with |w| max 102.67 m/s against 1.680.  Every step was
finite and two arms were byte-identical, so it is a different SOLUTION and
not an unstable one -- which is worse, because nothing crashes.

Every mesh the ruling covers sits between six and twenty-four times the
proven call rate.  So the ruling and the measurement point the same way, and
this gate is where they meet.

**Fixed means default.**  A bare run on a sub-3-km mesh selects no cumulus
scheme, with nobody passing a flag.  The explicit switch is an A/B
instrument -- it is how the attribution above is measured -- and a decision
taken through it says ``source: "explicit"`` in its own receipt so it can
never be read as the remedy.

**On a uniform mesh the finest spacing decides.**  The decision takes the
smaller of the row's declared nominal spacing and the mesh's own measured
``min(dcEdge)``, so a row that declares one resolution and carries another
cannot smuggle the closure back on.

**On a variable-resolution mesh each cell's SCHEME spacing decides
(2026-10-11).**  MPAS-A hands every cumulus scheme the cell's own length
scale, ``len_disp / meshDensity**0.25`` (``mpas_atmphys_driver_convection.F
:718``, ``:840``), and the scale-aware schemes (Grell-Freitas, New Tiedtke)
fade their closure out toward convection-permitting cells from that number.
A hexagon's ``min(dcEdge)`` is not that length: on the 48-3 km patch mesh
it is 2,778.75 m where the finest cell's scheme spacing is 3,000.28 m, and
on the 60-3 km mesh the finest cell's is 3,034.9 m.  Read at ``min(dcEdge)``
the 3 km ruling switched the scheme off for the WHOLE mesh, its 48-60 km
cells included.  THE BREAKAGE THIS CLOSES, MEASURED (2026-10-11, the 48-3 km
patch mesh, GFS 2026-10-03 12Z):
the bind logged "finest spacing 2778.8 m vs 3000 m threshold -> off" and
the run made no convective rain in any cell.  So on a mesh whose per-cell
spacing varies, the rulings' bands are read at the finest cell's scheme
spacing, the scheme runs in every cell with that cell's own spacing, and
its scale awareness does the fading -- MPAS-A's own way for meshes that
reach convection-permitting cells (its ``convection_permitting`` suite runs
scale-aware Grell-Freitas on the 60-3 and 15-3 km meshes).  Reading the
bands at the finest cell keeps every registered variable row on the scheme
it was anchored with.  The column seam has no per-column cumulus switch, so
a variable mesh whose finest cell is under 3 km keeps the whole-mesh
``off`` it had before, and its receipt names the scheme its coarse cells
would take.

**Convection-off is a NEW admitted configuration, not a mutation of the
proven one.**  How often a scheme is called is part of what a timestep
anchor certifies (:mod:`woof.hex.dt_admission`), so a convection-off run
earns its own anchors and cannot borrow the Grell-Freitas rows'.  The
frozen v8.4.1 column-physics lane's proven configuration stays exactly
reachable and byte-unchanged.

**The arbitrary acceptance test.**  Selecting the scheme is table work in
one place: a threshold, a named set, and one translation between the config
vocabulary and the sealed constructor's.  Adding a scheme is a row here, not
a new configuration subclass per combination.
