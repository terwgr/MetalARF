"""A kept hex run's state at one of its later frames, as the analysis file the remaps read.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES.  A hex region cut from a kept hex parent (``woof hex regional --parent-*``, the WOOF "keep this
run usable as a start" route) starts at any of the parent's stored frames, not only at its start.  The two remaps that
build the region (``woof.hex.analysis_remap`` for its start, ``woof.hex.nest_boundary`` for its boundaries) read the
parent's state at the region's start as an *analysis*: an initial-conditions file with the parent's geometry, vertical
grid and reference state.  A forecast history frame is not one (it carries no reconstruction coefficients, no vertical
grid and no base state), and the parent's init is the state at the parent's start, hours earlier.

What this does, and nothing more: it rehydrates the frame on the parent's own grid with the native cold loader (the same
``nest_boundary.load_history`` the boundaries use), writes its prognostic state (dry density, modified potential
temperature, normal and vertical velocity, all six water species, and the region's number species --
carried from the frame or diagnosed, :mod:`woof.hex.handover_numbers`) into a copy of the parent's init by dimension name
(``analysis_remap.write_fields``), carries every other time-varying field the frame and the init both hold with the same
shape (the land and sea state, snow, ice, number concentrations), and stamps the frame's valid time on all three MPAS
clocks (``analysis_remap.stamp_analysis_time``).  Geometry, vertical grid and reference state stay the init's own: the
frame is checked to be on the init's mesh (indexToCellID and indexToEdgeID) before anything is written.

No numerics of its own beyond the number diagnosis: the state is the frame's, moved into the init's layout.
