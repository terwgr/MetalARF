"""Advisory file locks that work on POSIX and on Windows.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (hex 0.4.1 doors, Windows desktop, 2026-10-20):
the asset fetch, physics-resources fetch, init, s2s and cycle doors imported
``fcntl``, which Windows does not have, so ``woof hex fetch-assets`` died with
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fcntl'`` on every Windows install.
Windows has no shared lock through ``msvcrt``, so a shared request is taken
exclusively there: the same exclusion, less read concurrency.
