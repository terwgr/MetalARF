"""Dycore step certificates: evidence a run records, not a gate it passes.

The key includes RK order, acoustic count and dynamics splits. Reusing an
RK3 certificate at order 2 would conceal different first-stage timesteps,
coefficient reuse and scalar density weights, so a row names exactly the
schedule its native schedule bits and device contract receipts measured.

RETIRED AS A GATE (owner ruling 2026-10-10).  ``require_step_anchor`` refused any schedule without a row; this
module now only answers whether the run's schedule matches one, and the run
writes that answer into its receipt.  Native MPAS dry-step agreement is measured with explicit tolerances by
verify-dycore. A schedule certificate alone does not establish agreement.
