"""Which column-physics backend a configuration selects, as table work.

The port owns no parameterization arithmetic.  Every physics column runs
through a woof column-batch seam, and until now there was exactly one: the
frozen ``woof.core.mpas_column_batch.run_mpas_column_batch``, bound by
:mod:`woof.hex.cuda_arwen_physics_v841` and byte-pinned by that adapter's
sixteen-file ``ARWEN_SOURCE_MANIFEST``.

Adding a second physics variant must not be a second code path through the
first.  ``mpas_column_batch.py`` is one of the sixteen files the production
adapter pins by SHA-256, so a dispatch arm inside it moves bytes that the
execution anchors are keyed to and forces a re-mint campaign.  This module is
therefore the TABLE the variants plug into: a backend is a ROW naming the
adapter module, the batch module it binds, the scalar registry it integrates,
and the anchor configuration class its evidence is filed under.  Adding a
variant is one row; the frozen row's bytes never move.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, and why the table refuses a rebind.  A registry
whose rows can be replaced is a registry where importing a module changes what
the DEFAULT configuration runs.  The default row here is the frozen lane, and
:func:`register_backend_row` refuses any name already present -- so no
optional module, however imported, can rebind ``wsm6_column`` to something
else, and ``tests/test_physics_backend_rows.py`` measures that the default
row resolves identically before and after every row provider is loaded.

WHERE FURTHER ROWS COME FROM.  A row whose implementation is not part of this
distribution is contributed by another installed distribution through the
``woof.hex.rows`` entry-point group (:data:`ROW_ENTRY_POINT_GROUP`).  The
table never names a provider: an install with no such distribution resolves
exactly the frozen row, and one with a provider resolves its rows too.

WHAT A ROW DOES NOT DO.  A row does not admit a run.  Admission is the
existing machinery -- :mod:`woof.hex.dt_admission` for the physics cadences,
:mod:`woof.hex.timestep_admission` for stability,
:mod:`woof.hex.device_admission` for the card,
:mod:`woof.hex.cuda_backend.arch_admission` for the architecture.  Whether a
row's configuration class holds anchors is a record, never a refusal
(retired 2026-10-10).
